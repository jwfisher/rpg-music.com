<br><br><br>

It is around noontime.  Arek’s three black dragons are in their tubes in the incubation room.  The room is down the hall from Arek’s throne room.  He is sitting in his throne once again, with an evil grin on his face.  He watches the very nearly complete dragons in their developing.
<br><br>
With an evil tone Arek said, "Yes..."
<br><br>
Arek thinks and looks around.  He called to Egar, "Egar!"
<br><br>
Egar is eating his lunch.  Sinistrals generally don’t eat, but they can if they want to.  Egar was trusted by now by Arek that he wouldn’t try to escape (although it was impossible anyway).  He’s been here for 111 years already.  Egar also knows that Arek, could kill him at any time anyway.  He comes into the chamber room where Arek is sitting in his throne, "Yes, master?"
<br><br>
"It has been nearly one year now, and the time to act is almost here.  My black dragons are close to ready and in one month I will have my revenge!  HA HAHAHA!!!" said the sinister Sinistral, "Turn on the tele-view.  I want to see what those three humans are doing.  First tune on to Aguro."
<br><br>
Egar goes to the right wall and presses a few buttons, the screen comes down, and the sound is on.  Aguro is in his hometown of Lorbenia.  He is talking to a soldier outside the Lorbenian army headquarters:

<br><br><br><br>

<DIR>
<i><font size=3>Soldier: &#9;"Commander Aguro!  Where are you going?  We’re training recruits today.  You have to be there!"
<br><br>Aguro:  &#9;"I have something else to do.  I leave the training to you.  You can do it.
<br><br>Soldier: &#9;"But!  It’s my first time!  I can’t...!"
<br><br>Aguro:  &#9;"Silence!  Stop moaning!  Just do it!  That’s an order!"
<br><br>Soldier: &#9;"Yes, sir!"
<br><br>(Lorbenia is a coastal town.  Aguro huries to the northeast dock.  Jerin is there.)
<br><br>Aguro:  &#9;"Sorry to be so long, Jerin."
<br><br>Jerin:  &#9;"It’s been a year.  Hasn’t it, Aguro?"
<br><br>Aguro:  &#9;"Yes."
<br><br>Jerin:  &#9;"I wonder what happened to Jack?"
<br><br>Aguro:  &#9;"I don’t know.  He’s not in Alekia.  I don’t know where is now, but..."
<br><br>Jerin:  &#9;"But what?"
<br><br>Aguro:  &#9;"I know I’ll see him again.  I just feel it."
<br><br>Jerin:  &#9;"Yes.  I feel the same thing.  We’ll see him again"
<br><br>Aguro:  &#9;"A year has passed, Jerin.  And there’s something I want to ask you."
<br><br>Jerin:  &#9;"What’s going on, Aguro?  It’s not like you to be so serious."
<br><br>Aguro:  &#9;"How long do you think you’re going to stay in this town?
<br><br>Jerin:  &#9;"What?"
<br><br>Aguro:  &#9;"What do you mean, ‘What?’.  A year ago, you said there was no place for you to go.  So I brought you here.  And yet, you’ve never looked for a new home."
<br><br>Jerin:  &#9;"What are you saying?  Am I bothering you?"
<br><br>Aguro:  &#9;"Yes.  You’re bothering me.  Thanks to you, I can’t even eat unless I serve in the army!"
<br><br>Jerin:  &#9;"Hey!  I earn my keep, don’t I?"
<br><br>Aguro:  &#9;"It costs more that that when two people live together.  I don’t even have a girlfriend!"
<br><br>Jerin:  &#9;"You couldn’t find a girlfriend even if I wasn’t living with you!"
<br><br>Aguro:  &#9;"You weren’t cute when I met you!  One year later, you’re still not cute!"
<br><br>Jerin:  &#9;"I don’t care if you think I’m cute or not!"
<br><br>Aguro:  &#9;"What an attitude!  No wonder you can’t find a place to live!"

<br><br><br><br>

Arek said, "Okay Egar.  That’s enough of those two.  Turn on to Jack."
<br><br>
"Oky doky," said Egar.  He goes to the buttons and presses a few.  Jack is in the town of Arus.  They watch:

<br><br><br><br>

<DIR>
<i><font size=3>Jack:   &#9;"Arus village.  Lufia’s favorite flower, Priphea, was in full bloom then."
<br><br>(Jack walks towards the back side of the town.  There is a field of Priphea, a house a few yards away, and a girl is there.)
<br><br>Jack:   &#9;"........!"
<br><br>Girl:   &#9;"Hello.  Are you a traveller?"
<br><br>Jack:   &#9;"Yes.  I’m Jack.  I’ve been traveling around the world for a year now."
<br><br>Girl:   &#9;"Around the world?  I envy you.  I’ve never been far from the village."
<br><br>Jack:   &#9;"Excuse me, but may I ask you name?"
<br><br>Girl:   &#9;"I’m Lufia.  I live in this village with my grandfather."
<br><br>Jack:   &#9;"Lu...Lufia?"
<br><br>Lufia:  &#9;"Is there...is there something wrong with my name?"
<br><br>Jack:   &#9;"No!  Not at all."
<br><br>(Lufia turns to face the house)
<br><br>Lufia:  &#9;"Oh, Grandpa!"
<br><br>(An old man walks down along side of Lufia.  This old man name is Flake.  He is a very wise elder that has helped Jack and his friends in their travels not more than a year ago.)
<br><br>Lufia:  &#9;"Grandpa, this is Jack.  He’s been traveling around the world."
<br><br>Flake:  &#9;"Oh my!  Welcome to our little village.  We’re simple people, but please enjoy your stay here."
<br><br>Lufia:  &#9;"Say, Grandpa, if it’s alright, why don’t we let him stay with us?  I want to hear about the world outside this village."
<br><br>Flake:  &#9;"Now, that’s a good idea.  What do you say, Jack?  Would you tell her some of your stories?"
<br><br>Jack:   &#9;"Of course.  I’d be happy to."
<br><br>Lufia:  &#9;"Oh, thank you!  I’ll go and make some tea!"
<br><br>(Lufia leaves and goes into the house to make tea.  Jack turns to Flake.)
<br><br>Jack:   &#9;"Tell me, Flake.  Who is she?"
<br><br>Flake:  &#9;"That’s Lufia."
<br><br>Jack:   &#9;"That can’t be true!  Lufia is..a year ago...I...."
<br><br>Flake:  &#9;"We moved her to this village after her fall from Doom Island.  She was weak, but she survived."
<br><br>Jack:   &#9;"So, you’re saying that she’s really Lufia?"
<br><br>Flake:  &#9;"Yes.  She’s Lufia alright.  But she can’t use her magic now."
<br><br>Jack:   &#9;"What do you mean, she can’t use magic?"
<br><br>Flake:  &#9;"She’s just an ordinary girl now."
<br><br>Jack:   &#9;"But, why....?"
<br><br>Flake:  &#9;"Maybe because of the Dual Blade.  Its great power affects people in different ways.  The blade’s energy changed Lufia.  Her magic and her memory...all gone."
<br><br>Jack:   &#9;"Changed her?  How can that be?"
<br><br>Flake:  &#9;"No doubt about it.  When I found her, she couldn’t even remember how to speak."
<br><br>Jack:   &#9;"Well, what about her memory now?"
<br><br>Flake:  &#9;"I taught her what she knows.  Parts of that are just an illusion."
<br><br>Jack:   &#9;"I didn’t know.  But why do you want me to help Lufia so much?"
<br><br>Flake:  &#9;"I don’t know. I just...."
<br><br>(Lufia steps out of the door)
<br><br>Lufia:  &#9;"Grandpa!  Jack!  Tea’s ready.  Come inside and relax."
<br><br>(Flake and Jack smell the cinnamon tea Lufia is holding.  The old Lufia a year ago, loved cinnamon, and made it all the time for Jack.)
<br><br>Flake:  &#9;"Oh, you made cinnamon tea.  You usually don’t make it.  What changed your mind?"
<br><br>Lufia:  &#9;"Well, we have a guest and I thought it would be nice."
<br><br>Flake:  &#9;"When my guests come, you make ordinary tea."
<br><br>Lufia:  &#9;"That’s not true!  Sometimes I make it for your guests!"
<br><br>Flake:  &#9;"Ha!  Ha!  That’s alright.  My friends alone can’t make you do this.  I understand.  But Jack is your own age, Lufia.  I know you’d want to do something special!"
<br><br>Lufia:  &#9;"What!  Oh, you!  How can you say that, Grandpa?  Forgive us, Jack.  Just ignore him."
<br><br>Flake:  &#9;"I see.  So, Lufia.  You’re saying you don’t like him?"
<br><br>Lufia:  &#9;"I never said that!  Let’s just have our tea, please."
<br><br>(Lufia goes back into the house.)
<br><br>Jack:   &#9;"It’s Lufia.  It’s really her, isn’t it?"
<br><br>Flake:  &#9;"Yes.  But she’s different from the Lufia you knew."
<br><br>Jack:   &#9;"I don’t care!  As long as she’s alive."
<br><br>Flake:  &#9;"Even without her memory?  She doesn’t even remember you."
<br><br>Jack:   &#9;"Memories......"
<br><br>Jack:   &#9;"That’s alright.  We’ll make new memories."
<br><br>(Lufia comes out of the house again.)
<br><br>Lufia:  &#9;"What are you two talking about?  Come inside, the tea is getting cold."
<br><br>Flake:  &#9;"Come, come on!  Lufia’s waiting."
<br><br>Jack:   &#9;"I’ll be right there!"

"Erim...Or what’s left of her. Erim is dead, but the body of Lufia survived.  Amazing," Arek sighs, "Will Jack and Lufia fall in love again?  If they do, it’ll make the revenge all the sweeter.  The three dragons will fall on the cities of Alekia, Lorbenia, and Arus.  My dragons will take care of those humans that killed Daos, Erim, Amon, and Gades and then they will take revenge on the rest of the world!  HA HAHAHAHA!!!"
<br><br>
Arek looks at Egar, "You may pull up the tele-view."
<br><br>
Egar turns off the tele-view.
<br><br>
Arek growls, "In one month I will have my revenge.  It is so close I can feel it.  Those humans won’t know what hit ‘em!!"

<br><br>

<b><center>At Flake’s house in Arus</b></center>

<br><br>

Jack, Flake, and Lufia are in Flake’s kitchen, sitting at a table, their tea in front of them.  Jack speaks first.
<br><br>
"Good house Flake and Lufia."
<br><br>
"Thank you, Lufia keeps up the place pretty well.  She takes great care of me."
<br><br>
"Awww Grandpa, stop it," Lufia said with a smile, "So Jack, tell me what the world is like out there."
<br><br>
Jack replies, "Before I answer that, I want to say what great cinnamon tea you make!  I love it.  And you look really nice today."
<br><br>
"Why, Thank you!" said Lufia.  She couldn’t stop smiling.
<br><br>
Flake inputs, "She makes great cinnamon pie too."
<br><br>
Jack is surprised; the old Lufia loved to make cinnamon pie, "Really?  I love cinnamon pie."
<br><br>
Jack remembers old Lufia’s cinnamon tea, the greatest in the world.  This tasted just like it!  It made him want some of Lufia’s cinnamon pie too.
<br><br>
Lufia looks at Jack, "You do?  Well, I’ll just have to make you one sometime, won’t I?" she pauses then says, "So now, can you tell me something about the outside world?"
<br><br>
Jack is wondering off looking at Lufia, and it took him a second to respond, "Oh, yes. It’s umm.  It’s green." 
<br><br>
Jack is having a hard time concentrating.  He hadn’t seen Lufia in such a long time.  He tries to keep in mind that Lufia isn’t the same person as she used to be.  But Lufia does seem mysteriously similar.
<br><br>
Lufia laughs, "It’s green, is it?  I’d surely hope so."
<br><br>
Jack laughs with her, "Yeah.  The world is green. Haha.  Well, to start of is that there are mountains and many seas..."
<br><br>
Jack goes and talks about the various towns.  A few adventures he had been in.  Through this whole time, Jack and Lufia couldn’t stop looking at each other.
<br><br>
After awhile, Lufia made supper.  After a couple more stories, it is now late evening, the sun had gone down.
<br><br>
Jack gets up, "It’s getting late now, I should probably get going..."
<br><br>
Flake cut it in, "Where are you sleeping tonight?  I had heard you don’t go back to Alekia anymore."
<br><br>
Jack is a little stunned, "Umm... I usually stay at a hotel."
<br><br>
Flake has an idea, "Why don’t you spend the night here?  You could tell Lufia more of your adventures and...maybe...you could...get to know each other?"
<br><br>
Lufia still has her eyes on Jack, "Umm..." she had wandered, "Oh, yeah.  That’s real nice of you Grandpa," she turns to Jack, "Would you like to?"
<br><br>
Jack is off in lala land, "Sure!  Thanks a lot Flake.  That would be great."
<br><br>
Flake turns to Lufia, "Then it’s settled!  I’m happy.  Jack can sleep on the couch.  Lufia, could you get a pillow and a blanket for Jack?"
<br><br>
"Sure, Grandpa.  I’ll be right back, Jack.  We’ll have fun tonight!"
<br><br>
When Lufia had left, Flake turns to Jack, "So what do you think of her?"
<br><br>
"What do you mean, ‘What do you think of her?’  That sure is an odd question."
<br><br>
Flake corrects himself, "I mean, how does she seem to the old Lufia?"
<br><br>
"Oh, okay.  She acts the same, I haven’t seen any differences, and she makes cinnamon tea and pie?  Why is she so similar?" Jack asked.
<br><br>
"Well, when I told Lufia what she knew, I had remembered her from our meeting a year ago.  The old Lufia had told me she liked to make stuff with cinnamon in them.  And I guess her values and attitude stay even with amnesia.  It’s mainly her past that is an illusion.  I had told her that her parents passed away when she was 10, and she’s lived with me ever since.  Explaining the amnesia, I told her that she was swimming one time, a big wave of water came in, swept her to hit her head with a rock.  After a few hours had passed, I got worried, and I found her."
<br><br>
Jack thanks Flake, "That explains it, thanks.  I have a question, are you trying to hook Lufia and I up?  Inviting me for tea, then asking if I want to stay for the night?"
<br><br>
Flake, a little embarrassed, says, "Well, you were in love with her before were you not?  You said that she is similar to the old Lufia.  And besides, Lufia needs somebody.  She needs to have someone like you, Jack.  Someone of the same age.  I’m getting old now and I won’t be around forever.  I’ve noticed you two couldn’t keep your eyes off each other."
<br><br>
"Well, that’s true.  I did love Lufia, the old Lufia that is.  This Lufia is still different.  She is stunningly similar though.  I’m not sure what to do.  I would definitely like to find out about the new Lufia."
<br><br>
Flake replied, "That’s good.  All you can do is to follow your heart..."
<br><br>
That’s when Lufia came back.  She came into the kitchen and says, "It’s all ready Jack."
<br><br>
"I’m glad we had a good talk," Flake said to Jack, "I should get to bed.  You two go and talk some more."
<br><br>
"Good night, Grandpa," said Lufia cheerfully.
<br><br>
"G’night Flake," said Jack and added, "And Flake?...Thanks."
<br><br>
Flake smiled and went up the stairs to his room.  Lufia and Jack go into the living room and sit on opposite sides of the couch.  Their legs overlap and so they are fully looking at each other.
<br><br>
"So..." said Jack.
<br><br>
"So..." repeated Lufia.
<br><br>
"What do you think of what I’ve said so far?"
<br><br>
"It’s great.  I never knew our world was that big.  I thank you a lot!"
<br><br>
"I haven’t gotten into half of it!"
<br><br>
"Really?  Wow.  Could you tell me more?"
<br><br>
"Yeah, I’d love to..."
<br><br>
Jack continues talking.  This goes on for hours.  Lufia talks about herself and some of her experiences.  Then they talk about everything else practically.  It gets so late they both fall asleep on the couch.

<br><br>

<b>After that night Jack decides to stick around Arus village.  Jack and Lufia start to date.  Flake likes what is happening.  He is happy for both Jack and Lufia.  This goes on for a few weeks.  All is well until...</b>
