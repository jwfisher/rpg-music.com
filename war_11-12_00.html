Thragnar. He was a gigantic Minotaur, not as big as the image they saw in the previous town- but oddly similar in appearance. He sees Kamain, and bows. "You have finally come. Now, you must fight with me one on one so I know you are wearthy. When you prove yourself, I will join you." Kamain is simply stunned but quickly regains his composure. "Uh, have I seen you before?" the minotaur replies, "You saw my spirit, I sent it to help you on your way to me. Now, we duel." Thragnar pulls a large axe from a strap on his back, and holds it in front of him.

Kamain is still a little confused and words start to form on his lips. He does not get a chance to peep up, instead he notices the large axe, and dodges aside. The gigantic weapon lodges itself into the ground. Kamain's eyes follow it up its shaft, until he is staring into the minotaur's eyes. "We don't need to fight." Thragnar rips the axe free of the ground, and stands still, cradling it in his arms. The large bull-man gives a grunt and replies, "I suppose not. Especially since we will be allies." He puts his large hand out, and Kamain reaches for it. Smacking Kamain's hand away the minotaur roars "You fool, I told you- I need to test your strength! We fight!" Thragnar swings his axe about, smacking walls, which crumble upon recieving the blows. Kamain leaps out of the way of each swing, and finally decides it is time to fight back. "I tried!" Kamain yells as he dives past another attack. He rolls between Thragnar's legs and stands up behind him. The minotaur begins to turn around, when mercifully, Kamain stabs him in the joint of his leg. Thragnar goes whirling to the ground, and hits with a loud thump. Kamain looks down upon him and muses, "I warned you. Now perhaps we can stop this nonsense." Thragnar stares intently at the victor. "You seem worthy enough. Have you obtained Shiva?" Kamain nods and counters, "You seem worthy yourself. But what was all that with Shiva?" Thragnar snorts and answers, "Ah, I will tell you.  When you defeat certain foes, they will be absorbed into your sword. Only those souls powerful enough will be harvested. The rest- crushed." Kamain nods slowly again and from behind Sage remarks, "Hence the name." Kamain begins to speak but is stopped short by the booming voice of Thragnar. "What Shiva does for you while in there is that now it has the Ice Elemental property. You can turn it on or off at your will. So if you are fighting a Fire enemy, turn it on. If Ice enemy, turn it off."  "I will tell you of the main Elements also. Each one has a nemesis. Fire and Ice. Lightning and Earth. Dark and Light. There are some sub-elements such as Poison, Gravity, and Water. Those are some elements that you may gain through your journeys. And believe me they can become very useful." Kamain digests all the information that was presented to him hastily and immidietly comments, "So are you with us or what? There is me, I am Kamain. The beautiful woman back there is Lin... The cloaked guy is Sage, and the other beautiful, young woman is Jewel. Jewel visibly blushes. We would be happy if you helped us... who are you anyway?" The minotaur breathes heavily out his nostrils. "I am Thragnar. The last remaining Dredgoon. My clan was decimated by some force from Hell.  Bastards." Jewel gingerly strides up next to Kamain, and says, "I would be happy to have you in out party, Thragnar." Thragnar grunts loudly, obviously unhappy with his new nickname 'Thragnar'. "You may call me whatever suits you."  "Thragnar, we came to help our friend Alvato. Do you know anything of him?" Thragnar shakes his head and then Lin jumps in. "Hey! Look at the map! It is changing!" On the map, a rough sketch of thier world is drawn. There is a mark where Kamain once was a bouncer, then a line drawn to another X at a place labled "Monastary of Sage", then another X at the town of Kolpos- where they saw the illusion of Thragnar that helped them defeat the zombie. A line begins to take form on the map- all by itself. The ink goes all the way to the south of the map, where after the line is made, it is labled 'Castle Deamonile'. Kamain jumps back and exclaims, "That is everywhere I have been since I met you Lin!" Lin mumbles, "No, ever since you met the map. Don't you see? You are the one that is destined to save our world. I understand that, and you must too. But still you must not... let it go to your head." She gives a quaint smile and rolls up the map.  "Where do we go now?" Kamain ponders. Thragnar booms in, "There is someone who could help us all. Teach us new abilites and strengths. We must travel back north-east, to the 'McHeart Chatuea'.  He is my friend, a rather rich man, who is always looking to help and reach new powers. You must refer to him as McHeart or else he will not be happy. We must only please him if we're to gain new skills from him." Sage speaks, "I would like to learn more spells. I really want to be able to summon comet. Heheheh..." Everyone gives him accusing glances, and his laugh fades away. "What?!"  Bursts out Sage. Kamain shifts his weight to one foot and begins, "Well, I think we should go there too. Being as how I have good leadership qualites, a clear head, and great battle skills, I think I should be the leader of this group." Thragnar stops Kamain's gloating, "I was going easy on you. Do you really think I was going to kill you?" Lin leans against a far wall and murmurs, "I just had to tell him he was the chosen one... I knew he would get all big-headed. Hmph!"  Jewel slinks up behind Kamain and quickly grasps his mouth shut before he could talk any further. "Shh. Don't get everybody angry. You should be more polite- Bragging just doesn't fit such a cute guy like you." She releases Kamain, who begins to turn red, and replies, "I, uh, guess I just let it get to my head to easily. Sorry." Lin seems to be getting ever impatient and slowly grows angry. "Come on! Are we gonna go today!? Kamain!!" She turns and stalks out of the room. Sage slowly chases her, followed by Thragnar. Kamain turns to Jewel. "How old did your father say we were? He got me all confused." Jewel's eyes furrow, and she replies, "We are not physically 7,000- only kinda spiritually. You have the 'Infinite War' and I have that many years of knowledge." Kamain smiles and says, "So you are not only pretty, but you're smart too?" They both look at each other intensly, and Kamain suddenly remembers. "Hey, we gotta get going!" He begins out the door. "C'mon!" Jewel watches him for a little bit and sighs deeply, and then follows after him.

Walking behind Lin and Sage, Thragnar hears running footfalls from behind. He turns to look, swinging his masive horns around with his head. It is Kamain. "Hey, Thragnar. I wanted to ask you something..." Thragnar faces forward and continues walking, and after a few moments of silence Kamain asks, "McHeart... who is he exactly?" Thragnar inhales deeply and responds, "Mr. McHeart was once a daring adventuring, just as you are. He would seek out fortune and fame. Acquiring both in his travels, when he got older he settled down on a platuea in the center of a canyon." Kamain nods his understanding. "Well then, what kind of 'powers' can he teach us?" Thragnar looks over at Kamain with a serious expression. "McHeart is not to be doubted. He can hone you're skills so fine that you will be able to defeat even me in a fair match." Kamain giggles a little and under his breath says, "Phhht! That was a real fight..." Echoing off the walls comes Thragnar's loud voice, "What was that? I think you better watch your tounge- while you still have it." Kamain gives a frightened look, and runs ahead of Thragnar.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Name: </b><A HREF="mailto:silk_z@hotmail.com">Sage</A><br>
Lin slows her pace and starts walking beside Sage. "Quite the crowd of travelers you've fallen in with old man." "I'm probably older then you think."Repleys Sage with a pang of hurt in his voice, Sages studying a scroll in his hands. "Know what I heard? I hear that McHearth has a vast treasured stored in this place. I wonder if he's to busy to notice a bit of gold missing." Sage starts to say some thing not really paying attention to what he heard "yes, that's nice keep up?....vast? how vast?" "oh, from what I heared it's up there in the millions." Just then Jewel turns her head sharply, maybe it was the light, but her one lock of white hair looked like it had an irritated glow "Will you two knock it off, we're here to learn not steal." "but Jewel" Sage beings, but Jewel gives him a very penetrating look. Sage suddenly stops talking. Lin whispers to him "Is she really that powerful?" Sage looks in Jewels direction and then turns to lin "Not as powerful as me..but" be hesitates for a second "she does prepare the food that we all eat so it's not a good idea, if you wish to stay healthy, to get her angry." Lin laughs "hahah, ain't that the truth." They continue walking with the others.

Kamain finally catches up with the rest of the group, leaving Thragnar behind. He is laughing at what little he heard coming from them. "Hey, Sage! Heh, it's McHeart, not McHearth!" Sage looks around casually and replies, "Uh, yeah I know. Thrangar said-" Sage is interupted by Kamain, "What is wrong with you? Thrangar?! It is Thragnar! Sage, I swear- your old age is getting to you!" Sage gives Kamain a stern glance and replies under his breath, "I was just kidding around, so you can stop with the insults." Kamian jogs ahead of Sage, then past Jewel giving a nod, and then he gets up to Lin. "Hey, Lin." He walks with her. "What do you want?" Answers Lin in a snap. Kamain puts his hands up in the air and says, "Calm down, be calm! I just wanted to ask you if I could see your weapon. I saw earlier how you created a beam of light with it." Lin keeps walking straight as she replies, "Not a chance in hell. You got your own 'Soul Shattering Sword', so why don't you just be happy with that?" Kamain backs away, and counters, "I sense a slight problem with your attitude- try to calm down. We are allies, are we not?" Lin stops walking. She looks over at Kamain and plainly answers, "Yeah, I guess you are right. It is just that I feel overpowered. When we get into a battle I get sorta left behind. Sage and Jewel are some kinda mages, while that 11' tall minotaur is as strong as a score of krakens. And you- wow. You are the most powerful... and getting better each moment." They look at each other for a moment and Kamain quietly says, "You are a great help. Once we get to McHeart's place I'm sure you can hone your fighting skills. Hey- maybe your sword can gain power too! ...Can I see it?" Lin wipes here cheek and breathes deeply as she pulls forth her long, thin sword. "What do you call it, Lin?" Lin watches her blade as she hands it to Kamain. "I call it... Fight Fantasy." Kamain nods as he handles the sword. He pulls forth his own weapon and holds them both up into the dank airs of the cave. Slowly he brings them down to waist level and a small spark of gold jumps from Kisakko to Final Fight. Kamain hands Lin her weapon and she gradually accepts it.  Lin bursts out, "What did you do?!" Kamain places a hand on her shoulder and waits for her to be silent. "I am not quite sure... but I think I just shared my sword's power with yours. You know how my sowrd can gain power... well now yours can. But- there is a gimmick. I figure the power is now split, and so that means these swords must never break, lest the powers of them both be lost. Get what I'm saying?" Lin nods slowly, and replies kindly, "Thank you. Kamain, you are very sweet. I'm sorry for acting so sour to you. Now, I can help out!" Just then Sage, Jewel and Thragnar stride into view. Kamian waves to them and turns back around, peering toward the exit. He notices a tiny glint of sunlight and calls, "The exit isn't very far." When the party gathers in a circle Jewel has a mad expresion on her face, and Begerath speaks, "Hehee... you'd be suprised how well voices carry in this place, Haha..." Kamain turns a shade of red and quickly changes the subject. "Yes, well lets get going- we don't want to be in this cave when dark sets... never know what kinda things come seeking shelter." Then with that, the group heads off toward the mouth of the Cave Of Deamonile.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Name: </b><A HREF="mailto:silk_z@hotmail.com">Sage</A><br>
Just as they leave the cave a giant spider beast is about to fall on to Lin but a giant axe swats it out of the air. "Carful, there's even stronger beast about in this area. It's best to be...." Thragnar is cut off from talking as a horrible noise is heard behind him "REHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH." the giant spider beast (that is supposably dead) leaps at lin and Thragnar, it manages to make a small cut on Thragnar arm. the ground under the spider rumbles a bit and a giant spike of rock shoots up and impales the spider. Some of the party turns and see Sage with his hand out, Kamain could swear he heard Sage say "impale" before the spike killed the monster. "Pesky things those spider.Thragnar are you alright, that thing looked pretty poisonious." Thragnar begins to laugh "you stupid human, unlike you I am immune to most poisons." "well I hope your immune to death, I wouldn't mind seeing if you are." Sage begins to glow and a golden nimbus begins to surround him. Lin and Jewel step in at that moment "Boys....errr...what ever you two are, can you please calm your testosteron, we don't have time for this squabbles." "Humph." Sage turns his back and begins to shiver into the form of a wolf "If you don't mind, I think I'll go and take a look up ahead, since we don't have "time" for any more fighting." "good idea old wolf" Jewel says. Kamain and lin and Thragnar look at each other. Kamain beigns to talk "did Sage just talk with out moving his lips...or am I going insane." Jewel turns aroudn to explain, by this time Sages pretty far ahead "When we turn into animals we can communicate with each other with our minds, or in the langauge of the animal you are. Pretty simple, father dosn't prefer the forms of birds, somthing to do with him not flying to well." Jewel beings to laugh to herself. kamain is still trying to figure this out as the party continues on.

Sage, still in his favored wolf form, runs up to the edge of the canyon. He comes to a halt, knocking loose small pebbles that cascade down the vertical slope. Behind him the rest of the team trudges up, and stops. Thragnar rumbles "That is the place- the large mansion in the middle." Kamain corks his head around to Thragnar and asks, "How are we supposed to get there? It's like an island!" Sage makes his observations and starts before anyone else, "Yes, and instead of water we have a very long drop. So, Thragnar," Sage chuckles a little then continues, "How do you propose we get there?" The mighty minotaur crosses his arms and replies, "Why don't you turn into a hawk and fly there?" The hair on the wolf's back begins to raise- a sign of irritation. "Jewel," He begins, "I don't want you talking about my... our small dilemas." Jewel giggles a bit and says, "What do you mean? I am not afraid of flight!" Kamain interupts the quarreling when he cups his hands around his mouth and shouts, "Hello! Mr. McHeart?" Thragnar strokes his long horn- it protrudes out horizontally from his skull, as does the other one. That is unusual- Sage thinks as he sees Thragnar grab his other horn and do the same thing. Most minotaurs have horns that stick out or up, and do so on a curve. Thragnar breathes in deeply and explains, "I will get us there- do not worry." Thragnar holds up his giant axe, and begins to slightly wave it around. The party notices he is reflecting the beams of light from the hot sun towards the Chatuea. After a moment of waiting, a floating gondola reveals itself near the house. It begins hovering toward the group, as they all stare in awe- save for Thragnar. "It is a gondola riding on top of very thin wires- invisible to the naked eye. That will be our way to the Chatuea." It comes to a halt next to them, and a door slids open. The small room is empty, and Thragnar stalks right in. "Come." He says, and with that, they all get inside except for Sage. He shakes his furry head no, and hops on top of the gondola. "I prefer it where I can easily escape, thank you." Then the transport lurches forward toward the McHeart Chatuea.

The Gondola comes to a stop, and the door slides open. Thragnar is the first to get out, followed by Kamain, Jewel and Lin. Sage jumps off the top, to the dry land. They all stand in front of the humungous mansion, staring in disbelief. "How goes it, Thragnar?" Comes the aged, but sly voice from the entrance. Out from behind the large double doors steps an older man with long white hair, a bandana on his forehead, and clad in a large white trench coat. He steps toward the party and gestures to them all. "I see you have brought guests." Thragnar snaps to attention and gives a low nod. "I be well, and I have brought these travelers to you in hopes that you would train them." McHeart replies, "I see. Who are they?" Kamain starts, "I am Kamain Abrodal." Next is Sage, "Sage." which is all he says. Then comes Lin, and she introduces herself as, "Hi, Lin here." Jewel peeps in next with, "Nice to meet you, Mr.McHeart. I am Jewel." McHeart nods at everyone, and follows up, "Yes, nice to meet you all. Perhaps once we are all inside we can get better acquainted. Oh, and it is just 'McHeart', ok? Let us be casual. Well, Thragnar, shall we?" Thragnar nods his approval, and steps closer to his one time teacher. A small blue cylinder of light appears between them. For a moment it floats, disappearing after. "I know of your adventures now, Kamain. It seems you really could get much better and quick- that is if you agree to do something for me." Kamian stares at him with a confusion playing on his face. "In order for me to train here I need to do something for you?  What is it that I need to do?" McHeart gives a wide grin.

"Kamain, I need you to...get rid of an assassain that has been plaguing me." says McHeart. "What? I heard you were suppose to be pretty strong yourself, why me?" asks Kamain. Thragnar and the others leave the room so Kamain and McHeart can speak to eachother in private. "If only it were that easy..." McHeart slowly explained. "You see, his name is Spectre, he is of the Balance Knights." Kamain looks away for a second. "Spectre? What kind of name is that?" McHeart speaks, "I doubt you have heard of the Balance Knights. They are an elite group of powerful knights." Kamain nods his head slowly and says, "But why should I have to deal with him? What is the reason for this?" McHeart glares at Kamain. "Don't ask questions...will you do this or not?" Kamain sighs and says "We'll do it, but I expect you to help me when I return." "Of course," replies McHeart. With that, Kamain walks into another room where the rest of the party is hanging out. "All right group, we have a little side mission," explains Kamain, "and that is...to defeat the Balance Knight, Spectre!" Lin suddenly turns around and yells, "Wait a sec, what's beating up this guy have to do with anything?" "Not sure," says Kamain. Lin retorts, "Don't you know how strong Balance Knights are?!" Kamain does a little laugh and smiles. "I'm PRETTY SURE that the 5 of us can beat one little guy, ok?" Sage murmers, "Hmmmm...still, we must be careful." With that, the group returns outside McHeart's residence and Thragnar starts walking down a road. "Where you going, Thragnar?" asks Jewel. "This is the way to Spectre's training grounds. He will be there." With that, the party heads off Spectre's lair, not knowing anything about why McHeart wants him beaten, not knowing what lies ahead...

So the whole party: Kamain, Thragnar, Sage, Jewel and Lin head down a steep trail on the side of the mesa. Thragnar leads the way, proclaiming he knows where this place is at. "This assassin has made his home near here? What's up wit' dat?" Sage asks in a slang language. Thragnar's booming reply is short and sweet, "Don't know." Kamain adds on, "Who cares? We're gonna kick his ass 'cause McHeart said so... and McHeart is our... friend. I trust him- Thragnar does." Kamain almost ended his sentance sounding like it was an appology. Thragnar points toward the bottom of the canyon, and explains, "Spectre lives in a cavern down there. Don't be suprised when you enter though..." Kamain, as well as the rest of the group eye the Minotaur strangly. Kamain asks, "What should we not be suprised about?" Thragnar gives another one of his short and sweet answers, "You'll see." In unison, the group- save for Thragnar- nod. Sage stumbles behind a little and gives a howl. Suprised, the party turns to look. They see that Sage has turned into a lumbering Werewolf, almost as large as Thragnar. They continue on, with Sage at the back, Thragnar still in front. Jewel calls back in a playful tone, "Father, you never howled before." Kamain and Lin chuckle. They all walk silently the rest of the way. When they step in front of the mouth of the cave, a disgusting foul stench invades thier senses. "Whoa!" exclaims Jewel. Thragnar gives a grunt, "Heh, we haveb arrived!"

Jewel says, "That smell...what is it?" Thragnar replies, "The stench of death." The group sees numerous dead beasts scattered across the cavern. "It seems like this Spectre guy didn't want these monsters in his cave." The group trudged further on, until they came across a dead end rock wall. Kamain whips out his blade, Kissako. He makes a powerful slash at the wall, but the blade only scratches the wall. "Argh...dammit." he says. Suddenly, the ground underneath the party opens up and they slide down a long shute until they all land in a large underground cavern, with multiple torches lighting the area. Fearful, they cluster together and look around. Right then, a figure materializes before them. "What do you want?" he asks. "You must be Spectre, the Balance Knight!" exclaims Kamain. "Indeed I am, but why have you trespassed onto my training grounds?" asks Spectre. Thragnar dashs forward, "We will defeat you in the name of Mr. McHeart!!" Spectre slowly hovers down towards the ground and makes a graceful landing. "That fool. Using all of you to attack me. I wonder what his scheme is?" Thragnar replies shouting, "How dare you talk of McHeart as if he is evil!" Thragnar dashes forward and swings his large axe towards Spectre, who effortlessly and instantly teleports behind Thragnar's clumsy attack. "Wha?" Thragnar tries to speak but Spectre grabs him by his horn from behind and brutally hurls him into a rock wall 20 feet away. Lin charges Spectre with her blade, but he teleports to avoid her slash, reappears, then whacks her with the flat of his sword. Lin is thrown back and unconcious. Kamain, Sage, and Jewel all take fighting positions and...

Jewel changes into a werewolf also, copying her father. Both Sage and his daughter charge Spectre. He stands perfectly still, acting as though he could care less. They both lunge for him, but only meet air. He reappears behind them and brings his arms back, elbowing them both in the backs of thier heads. Kamain watches as he easily defeats all of his assailants. "W-w-w-wait!" Kamain mutters. "If we're gonna fight... no lame disappearing tricks!" Spectre laughs coldly. "Life isn't fair. A lesson well learned in short time. Obviously, you need some help discovering it though. Let me help!" The assassin fades out of existance. Kamain searches all around for his enemy, but sees him nowhere. Spectre begins to appear to Kamain's right, and so he attacks the shape. His sword passes right through, and Spectre fully appears in front of Kamain. He rewards Kamain's attack with a swift punch to the face. "Ahh!" Yelps our hero. "Hahaha! Foolish old man! Sending children to do his work!" With the flick of his wrists, Spectre flings out two daggers, both of which he instanly catches. "Now, you die." The assassin dives for Kamain. Suddenly, Spectre is knocked off course by some unknown force. Kamain looks up to see McHeart standing, watching Spectre as he gets up. "Ah, the old man has come, has he? If you wish to die too, so be it." McHeart takes a step toward the foe, and counters, "I will not lose. Not with this young man next to me." Kamain is suprised that he has been recognized as a power. He stands up gingerly, whipsering, "What should I do?" McHeart only nods, but jumps toward Spectre. Spectre holds out his daggers, waiting for the right moment to strike. He goes to take a swipe at the mid-flight McHeart, but slices through a blurred visage. McHeart comes into being behind Spectre, with a grin on his face. "I too, know the ways of Teleportation." And with that, McHeart grabs and keeps a hold on Spectre. He yells to Kamain, "Hurry! Finish the job! I can't hold him much longer!" Kicking and fighting his way loose, Spectre howls out, "Got that right, old man! Erraahh!" Kamain readies his sword, and swings. Spectre's grim head rolls across the rough ground. The Soul Shattering Sword, Kisakko, beams with black light: the power of death. As Kamain's sword resonates, so does Lin's. They both gain the power, due to thier link. "Hey!  McHeart! Why the hell did you want us to fight him, if you could take him on?!" McHeart sighs heavily. "I am old, you see. Out of breath already. He drained my powers faster than I thought. As you saw though, I was merely helping you defeat him. It was you all along who had the power to prevail... Now, let us go home." Then they all head off back toward the mansion.

They all enter a large room inside the mansion, the training grounds. "Teach me all you know!" Kamain says to McHeart. "You must be patient. You must observe others in battle beforehand before you yourself can start," says McHeart. Kamain looks at Thragnar, Jewel, Lin, and Sage. McHeart says, "You're friends Lin and Jewel shall test eachother's mettle first!" Lin looks around the says, "Wait a second, you want us to SLASH EACHOTHER UP?!" Sage notes, "That's not his intention." McHeart nods, "Edged weapons are too dangerous for training, so you each will be equipped with a bamboo pole." Jewel chuckles, "Hehe, sounds fun." Lin seems concerned, "But without my sword, I can't beat a magic user!" McHeart lets out a sigh. He then spins around and looks into Lins eyes. "Not quite true. You see, I recognize you as a Sword Mage!" Lin blushes, "I see you have figured that out." Kamain looks confused then says, "Well, she can teleport her sword from outta nowhere." Jewel looks at the ground and says, "She may be some Sword Mage, but I'm way stronger than her." Lin then adds, "Yeah that's ri....errr, wait a second! Grrr...." Tension fills the room and everyone backs off except Lin and Jewel. "Here comes the catfight..." sarcastically notes Kamain.  Jewel cracks her knuckles. "Little Lin wants to get burned does she? Whatever floats your boat!" Jewel dashes back quickly and raises her arm. "Burn those who stand in my way...FIREBALL!" A large flaming ball instantly zips across the room and explodes in Lin. On the sidelines Kamain yells, "What the hell are you doing!?!" A large rolling fire burns where Lin was standing. "Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Don't worry, I'll cast a heal spell on her." says Jewel. "Not neccesary!" a voice says. It is Lin, with her hand out, drawing energy from the air to create an energy blocking shield.  "Impossible!" says Jewel. Lin backs down her shield and charges a ball of energy on her left hand, and yells, "ENSHOU WALL!!" A large beam rips across the ground towards Jewel, who jumps high into the air to avoid it! Jewel says, "I see! Take THIS! IMPALE!!!" Large spikes quickly rise from the ground to stab Lin, but she quickly dashes through the air to where Jewel is hovering, casting her spell. Jewel is taken off guard, and Lin jams her bamboo pole as hard as she can into Jewel's stomach. "Aeiii!" says Jewel and she falls out onto the ground. "BLACK SHOCK!!" Jewel quickly gasps. Large black lightning bolts appear from out of nowhere and strike Lin who screams, "Ahhh!!!" Kamain yells to McHeart "They're killing eachother! Stop this!" McHeart just watches as the battle is about to escalate. Kamain holds out Kissako, which glows with the icey-blue light of Shiva. Energy waves wash over Lin and Jewel, and they are soon completely encased in ice. "That should COOL then down, Eheheh." laughs Kamain. Sage suddenly....

Bursts out in histarical laughter. Kamain hesitantly says, "Come on, Sage, it wasn't that funny..." Sage goes on for a fewe more moments then follows up with, "That was a good one, Kamain."  Under his breath Kamain utters, "Riiiiiight..." McHeart looks around and breaks the silence with, "Kamain, that was unnecasary. For your interferance you must fight Thragnar. One on one with bare hands. Commence!" Thragnar instantly throws down his axe, and circles Kamain who is getting ready to defend himself. Sage mutters, "I didn't think Kamain would fight that willingly. He must be used to it by now... Hahahah!" Thragnar is the first to strike, coming in toward Kamain with a large fist. The minotaur's knuckles cut to the bone on Kamain's forearm as he tried to block it. Kamain reels back and jumps away from a second flying fist. Kamain begins to get a little tricky. He keeps jumping back, until he comes to the wall. Thragnar charges at him all the way and ends in a dropkick.  Ducking the large hooves, Kamain comes back up and jumps straight into the air. He gets up pretty high on his amazing jump, and pushes off the wall with a kick. Kamain is propelled foward, over Thragnar. He lands with grace, and turns around with a smile, only to meet another huge fist. Kamain goes spinning downward. He falls to the ground, grasping his nose. Thragnar gives a triumphant roar, and McHeart declares him the victor. "Don't get down on yourself, Kamain. I told you I was holding back before." says Thragnar, sympathetically. Kamain stands up, wiping the lifeblood from his bloody nose. "Dammit, I think you broke my nose!" Yells Kamain. Thragnar reaches over to Kamain, and grabs his skull like a melon. He flicks Kamain's head back with the snap of his wrist and says, "Keep your head tilted back." His recommendation being what was believed to be the answer in thier day. Kamain retorts, "Yeah, thanks a lot." The party turns to the frozen forms of Lin and Jewel. "Uh, what 'bout them?" says Kamain. "I don't have the fire power yet." He finishes his sentance with a wide grin.

McHeart says, "They should thaw out after your next training battle." Kamain looks around and says, "Who is it this time, Sage? I don't think you'd have me fight Thragnar again, and you're way too powerful yourself." McHeart does a little laugh and quietly says, "None of the people you see before you...show yourself!!" Kamain, Sage, and Thragnar look around wondering what's going on. A darkly familiar voice says, "I'm here for the one-on-one." Kamain looks up and is shocked. "SPECTRE!! I killed you!! What's going on here?!" Spectre slowly floats to about a foot off the ground. McHeart says, "I had that whole Spectre battle thing planned to help you gain experience, Kamain." Kamain is angry. "I still don't like this character though! How did I gain his energy after slicing off his head?"  McHeart says, "Just an illusion, and I fed some energy into your sword. You must have noticed you didn't really gain anything much, correct?" Sage is angry and says, "Yes, but why the whole act about Spectre being your enemy?!" McHeart turns around and says, "Don't worry, it's all for training purposes. Kamain, you may begin!" But right before they can battle...
