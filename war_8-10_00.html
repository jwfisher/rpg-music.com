It has been 50 years since the saga of Sir Gumpo and Bubba.  Peace has returned to the land....until now....Our story starts with a bouncer of a small town tavern, Kamain Kelineva.  He didn't look like your typical "bodyguard", but when he's on his shift he takes very well of the tavern if any ruckus happens...although there really has been much...it IS just a small town tavern.  Well today was Wednesday...the most boring day of the week, almost NOTHING happens.  Once in awhile he'll get an underage guy/gal trying to get in...or an occasional drunk making too much noise.  That night there were pretty much just a few humans, dwarves, and elves.  It seemed the dwarves were the ones to get into the booze the most.  The first few hours he was there it was like any other Wednesday...pretty boring. At 7:30pm a mysterious character entered the tavern.  It was then about a couple hours later he he saw something happening inside...

...an elf was starting to cause some trouble with the waitress. Kamain mumbled to himself, "Alright, time to kick an elf's ass!" Kamain didn't like elves that much...they always thought they were too clever. Kamain tapped the elf on the shoulder and he spun around with a long dagger drawn. He quickly made a slice for Kamain's neck, but he blocked it with his quick fighting skills. He whipped out his club he kept concealed and smacked the elf over the head, the elf fell to the ground. "Awww crap," the elf said right before he passed out. The waitress turned around...Kamain had never seen her before, it was her first day on the job. "Damn, she looks pretty hot," Kamain thought to himself.

"Oh! Thanks for helping me out there! My name is Lin, and I'm new here." Kamain looked at her and said, "Aww, no problem. What'd he want?" Lin kinda ducked her head then looked up at Kamain. "Oh no! You broke your club on his head!" Kamain didn't notice that she totally changed the subject, and replied "Yep, it was getting old anyway. That's just my whacking stick anyways..." Lin turned away, "Thanks, for helping me, but I can handle myself." With that, Lin spun around and teleported a sword into her hand. "Whoa!" exclaimed Kamain. "Just a little trick I learned from my last job." Kamain say magic users all around before, but she was different, it was a different form of magic manipulation. Anyways, Kamain was about to say something when a giant figure busted through the doors of the tavern. He was clad in armor, and very angry. "Lin, give me the map...NOW!!!" His name was....

"Kaar!"  Lin exclaimed, "What are you doing?  I'm working right now!"  Kaar replied, "Oh, don't give me that!  That map is not yours, and you know it!  That map is part of the museum, now give it back!"  Kaar was a guard in the museum of the nearby elven kingdom Freyart.  The map he was talking about was a map of the kingdom itself, so you would wonder why Lin would take it.  But it seems there is more to that map than the eye can see...

The map, now clenched tightly in Lin's hand, is sighted by the large elf, Kaar. He goes to make a grab for it, but misses, due to Lin's speed. She looks around frantically, and finally yells to Kamain, "Please! Protect me! This man is going to hurt me!" She tosses Kamain her created sword, and he catches it. "Look, Kaar, I don't know you, but leave this place now! You do not belong here!" He holds the blade out toward Kaar, who turns his head up and laughs heartily. "You do not presume to challenge me?! Fool! I will teach you a lesson!"  Kaar stabs out again with his own sword toward Lin, and this time hits her. Lin falls to the ground, holding her bloody stomach. She looks up in horror as she slowly fades away. Kamain is startled by this and then the shock turns to rage. At this point, other people in the bar begin the shuffle out the back door. Kamain screams and begins to tremble. He drops the sword. Kaar laughs deeply again, and is rewarded with another scream. Kamain screams once more, and then a small bright light is lit near his chest. The small ball of light begins to grow larger, then Kaar is forced to look away. When the light finally settles down, Kamain is gone. In his place stands a bright angel. It is wearing Kamain's outfit, but looks nothing like him.  Instead, he is a tall, slender man with handsome features and wings as white as snow. The angel begis to speak, "I don't know what just happened, but nevertheless, you will recieve your punishment!" The angel points at the visibly shaking Kaar.

Kaar shakes his head some short of trick he says to himself.  He then reaches for his sword to find that it has been melted.  The angel glides towards Kaar and grabs him by his shoulders, the angels snowy white wings wrap around kaar. "Face the wrath of your own evils."  The wings unwrap and a dead husk falls out.  Just then the angel burst into a glorious white light and kamain drops out uncouncies.  Lin "I found him at last....Lin then blacks out from lose of blood.  Later, Kamain wakes up in a hospital bed next to lin she appears to be ok and sleeping.  Kamain has a nasty bump on his head.  It seems that he can't remeber what happend or the fact about his transformation.  Lin begins to wake, but falls back asleep.  Kamain tries to remeber what happened, as he recalled he was fighting kaar but then saw Lin take a sword cut to the stomach.  Then he blacked out and he vaugley remebers being carried by the dark caped figure one he saw earlier.  He tries to think more but his head begins to hurt and he passes out again.

In from the single door of the room that has Lin and Kamain in it, comes a heavily robed man. His ebony cloak covers his body and all of his face save for his eyes, which can be seen like two burning suns. They are the sickly shade of green, and pulsate with strange power. He walks to Kamain's bed, and looks down upon him. The stranger shakes his head, and places a hand on Kamain's forehead. A second after, a green shock of lightning shoots down the man's robes, and into his hand, and then finally the energy flows right into Kamain.

Kamain is jolted into conseiousness.  He looks up at the cloaked figure and sees those green eyes.  They burn with an emerald pressence around them.  The figure removes his cloak "hello, I am father Alvato." the Priest says. "Welcome to the Santuary of the father hood."  "What about her" Kamain points towards Lin. "ahh, let me handle that, you just get up now, go down the hall and grab some food, third door to the left."  Kamain feels skeptical but decides to leave. He peers over his sholder before leaving.

As Kamain peers over his shoulder, he see's Lin, laying in her bed, unconcious of course.  He looks closer, and he sees something slightly sticking out of her pocket, it was a rolled up piece of paper.  He got curious and went by her bed and took it out.  He unfolded it and it was a detailed map of castle Freyart.  For the most part, it just looked like an ordinary map, but as he looked at it closer he saw...

Before Kamain can get a closer look at the map, it was levitated out of his hands and into father alvatos. "This does not belong to you, you where told to get food, I advise that you do that now.".  Kamain want's to know what's on that map "The hell I will" He leaps at alvato, but the priest just mearly teleports out of the way.  "DAMNIT, How did u...." The priest snaps his fingers and kamin is in a hall full of priest eating from soup bowls, they all where grey cloaks around there bodys.  Some have red crosses marked on there forhead, the rest have blue crosses. Kamain leans towards the monk besides him "Where am I?"

Alvatos says, "This room is the dining room of course!" Kamain is still a little agitated from being teleported. He doesn't like being teleported unanounced, it's freaky, but Kamain reply's "I mean, what is this? Where is this? What's the map about?" Alvatos shakes his head, "My my, a lot of questions." Sit down, eat now. Then all of a sudden Kamain was sitting with a bowl in front of him... *dammit, not again* Kamain thought. He was hungry though, so he had some "soup"...

Kamain goes to take a sip of the broth from the small spoon provided, put suddenly he feels a sharp pain in his chest. His eyes shoot open, wide in horror. He drops the spoon, knocks the bowl over, and stands up clenching his shirt. In heavy breaths he manages, "My, my heart is gonna, Agh! Explode!!" He steps backward and stumbles over his tiny seat. He doesn't notice the monks all watching in disbelief. One of them gets up and yells, "What is happening?!" Others start to scream and question.  Kamain struggles to breathe as he pounds on his chest. His eyes suddenly turn black, and he falls back, landing on the floor with a quiet thud. Above his unconsious body a strnge image is projected. The sight is of an Angel, and a Devil. They fight in an eternal battle. Kamain's body jolts with every attack. Many of the monks run from the sight, but those who stay shrink back into corners. Alvato appears and gasps at the sight. He mumbles, "This man is the one!? How can that be!? The 'Infinite War' lives within him... Just as the map indicated; like so many other scrolls said- 'Infinite War has resurfaced..."

The image is gradually sucked back into Kamain.  He covulses one last time and awakes with a scream.  Then he sits up and acts as if nothing happend.  By this time the only monk left is alvato.  "Do you remeber what happend just now?" Alvato ask impatiantly. "What are you talking about? I was just eating soup."  "just as I thought". thinks Alvato. "Sit down my son, let me tell you the story about a war between heaven and hell...it all began over 10000 thousand years ago, during the darker ages of the earth, evil was everywhere.  That is until heaven steped in and tried to fight the evil lords of the underworld.  You see, there are 5 gods in the heavens and 5 in hell, they are:  "Aulder, a compasionate god and eldest out of the 5 heaven gods.  He is extremly wise and knows much about the will and the word."  "what's that?" ask kamain.  "what's what?". "the will and the word?." "I'll explain after. any ways, next comes Ramulus, the mighty god of the barbarian tribes of the far north.  It is said that he once singal handedly took on 3 of the hell gods.  The next is Belair, a young and often naieve god. Once, when the gods walked the earth I heard Belair was popular with the ladies. The next is  "Nedra, the god of the merchants of Lor tora. I'll show you a map of the world latter since you obviously don't have a clue what I'm telling you.  Anyways, how many was that? Oh yes, the next one is tyriel no, not the one from diablo 2, for copy right purposes ^-^. The Gaurdian God of the heavens, he protects it with his light broad sword and holy shield and rumors say that he somtimes uses a spear of sheer gold must be magic."

"The last of the Heaven Gods is the most powerful and most respected. He may be the youngest, but he quickly gained leadership of all of Heaven." Kamain nods as Alvato tells him the story. "The youngest and most foolish of the devils is Vethra. He gives hells minions thier orders. Second is Gerras, and he was in charge of damning souls to hell. The third devil king, called simply Hellion, was charged with the duty to punish and torment those sent to hell."  Alvato stops for a minute to recall the rest of the legend. "The fourth of all most evil ones was called Zorak No, not Space Ghost...sheesh and he was the devil who planned war against the angels." Once again, Alvato stops to think. Kamain is still nodding. "And the last Devil of the five they called Hatred. He was the oldest of them all and the most experienced with torturing souls, waging wars, and ruling hell. This one had a terrible grudge against the Young Angel ruler, Love... Even more than he normally dispised enemies.  And the angel Love made Hatred go into a most petrifying battle frenzy, killing both ally and enemy alike. In one such an encounter Hatred destroyed his own brothers. The Devil did not so much as care about what he had done. Instead he killed all of the Angel kings except for Love. Love realized he had to contain this monstrous power, before others died. So in sacrificing his own future, Love trapped the King of Devils and himself in the soul of a normal human. They still fight to this day living inside the body of... you." Kamain stops his nodding and slowly replies, "Love and Hatred are in my... body?"

Alvato nods.  Kamain is confused, "How can it be me?  That war was so long ago."  Alvato replies, "Yes that is true, but it was handed down to you."  Alvato looks down, "I'm sorry about your father..."  Kamain is puzzled as he remembers it, his father died mysteriously a year ago, "How did you know my father passed away?"  "You see, the infinite war is passed down to the child when the parent passes away."  Kamain asked, "What if they have no children?"  Alvato replies, "It is then randomly handed down, you see I've been looking for you for some time.  I knew the last person before your father had it handed down to him."  Kamain is puzzled again, "Then how is it I never saw it in him?"  "It is only when the fighting becomes so intense it surfaces above the conciousness of the human," he sighs, "I've actually been looking for your father for 30 years, and when I found out he died and found he had a son, that was when I started to search for you.  You see, the what's been happening to you only happens every 300 years, and this is that time.  The priesthood I belong to keeps track of the one who has the infinite war within.  We usually do keep track, but once in awhile, they do not have children, so we have to go in a search; which was your father."

"So here you are at last..." Alvato takes a few steps back and sighs. "I was hoping it wasn't you, but I suppose on the other hand I finally found the one with the dangerous war living inside of them." Alvato shakes his head and breaths deep. Kamain gives a puzzled and frightened look as Alvato begins to call upon the arcane powers. "Wha-what are you doing?!" Alvato raises his right hand into the air and from it spews a ball of lightning. It strikes Kamain in the chest and he is flung back into the wall. "Ahh! Hey whats the deal?" Alvato answers him, "You see, I have to contain you for the common good."  "C-contain? What kind of joke?!" Kamian is frightened, and doesnt' understand what the priest is talking about. "Now don't try anything, boy. I am just gonna..." Alvato jumps up into the air and floats. He swings his arms around in front of him and suddenly stops after 5 revolutions. He screams, "Love and Hatred! I will bind you FOREVER!" Kamain suddenly pulses with new energy and a dark cloud fomrs in front of his chest. It envelopes him completely, and then quickly disperses. Where Kamain once stood, now towers a giant devil. The devil speaks in a raspy voice, "You cannot take me."

Despair flashed in Alvato's eyes...and he chanted another incantation! Rolling balls of flame burst into the devil! The raspy voice spoke out "Your magic only empowers me." With that, the devil's giant hand grabbed the face of Alvato and smashed it into the ground! "You fool..." mummered the giant devil and he prepared to deliver a killing blow to the unconscious Alvato! But right then, he felt the white hot sting of a sword passing through his back! Lin raises her sword upwards to inflict greater damage on the giant devil! "Arghhhh!" he screamed. Lin, using all of her strength pushed up on the sword as it sliced a gaping cut through the devil. He quickly spun around and grabbed his back in pain. "I will not perish so easily, especially by some girl with a sword!" screamed the giant devil. He stepped closer, staggering towards Lin. She charged the devil and made another slash! The sword cut deep into his chest. He winced in pain, but still kept trudging towards Lin. She suddenly found herself backed into a corner, with the behemoth slowly coming towards her. She raised her sword and...

As the devil neared Lin he grinned in anticipation. She shrank into the corner of the mess hall trying to make herself as small as possible. But then suddenly the Devil stopped and looked around in utter confusion…"What is this? This power I feel where is it coming from?" then from the entrance of the mess hall a wind began to blow forcing the doors open. The Devil looked toward the doors and his expression was that of pure hatred. "No it couldn't possible be him…" then the figure emerged from the entryway. Wearing a red cloak hood raised concealing his face in shadow a man entered the mess hall. As he headed toward the group small red lightning bolts danced over his cloak and he raised his head, face still concealed in shadow he  "I am Sage…leave now Devil…or you'll wish you had…"  As the devil spotted the cloaked figure his face gave an expression that was absolute fear. He quickly looked around the room and spotted the mangled body of Alvato and grinned. The devil leaped toward Alvato. Sage's eyes blowed red from the shadows of the cloak and he liftes his hand suddenly as two bolts of lightning that played over his cloak suddenly slashed through the air rocketing toward the Devil. But the devil's lead was already too great he reached the body of the mangled mage and disappeared into him.  Sage's eyes erupted in a red aurora and he lowered his hand. The mangled body of the mage rose and began to glow a dark red color. His back arched and he let out a deafening scream of pain.  As he screamed armor began to grow around him, shoulder pads formed and from them two spiked, then finally a breast and back plate. When all of this was over the former Alvato slumped over. Kamain rushed over to the seemingly exhausted mage but once he was mer three paces away he was flung back against a wall. Alvato raised his head and that's when it was first apparent to them all that he was no longer Alvato at all.  As he rose his face to them his eyes glowed a blood red and two horns that began at the front of his head and followed along the base of his scull were first apparent. Then he spoke with the same voice as the devil "now that I have a body of my own you will all feel the wrath of hell at it's fullest!" and with that he disappeared...

The mysterious sage begins to mumble a bunch of curses while kamin rushes over to Lin who is still holding out her knife in a fear full defense position. the sage walks over "This is bad, I didn't know he could split from your body.  Now there is only love...strange."  "WHO ARE YOU" kamain screams, while trying to snap lin out of her trauma like stat.  "I am Sage.  A disiple of auldur.  And the one you call lin is really princes Liselle Margravine of Sendar." "Sage" Liselle acussingly calls out "You said you wouldn't follow me."  Sage made a weary smile "I know, that's why I did it. You don't think I would let you wonder off alone, you are in this just as much as our young friend there is."  Sage pointed a hand at Kamain. Sage sighs "I guess it's time to drop this stupid disguise."  Sages body shimers for a second and then in his place is an old man with a beard down to his waist, wearing a brown tunic.  kamain could tell who this was now, he fell to one knee "Holy Sage, forgive me for not recognizing you."  "Oh get on your feet boy." he turned to liselle "I hate it when they do that.  And don't use that holy thing to lightly, I'm not as holy as I seem to be."   "But I thought you where a myth, I mean that..umm, I err....are you real?"   "Kamain, in just one day, you meet the head priest, seen the devil leave your body, became an angel, and meet the ummm, wisest man in the world."  Liselle gave him a picular look "You mean oldest man in the world." she corrected him  "Liselle, please."  "well you are, ancient Sage." "any ways, I think it's about time you have been put up to date kamain."  "First of all, there are two souls in your body, Love and your self.  Love will come out when He feels that the time is right. Secondly, We must track down the Devil, destroy him and free alvato."  Sage waves a hand and instantly an image appears of an evil looking castle. "behold, castle Deamonile. Located in the very heart of Dementia-Dane.  Some might call the place hell, it really isn't all that bad."  Sage continues "Any way, we must rescue your friend. I have read much about this in the prophocies of Aloria. Aloria's an ancient kingdom, long since dead.  Back to the subject.  U are the key to all this kamain.  Any questions before we leave?"  "Leave? where?"   "to find the other members of our party, it's said in the prophocies that we will find them on our journey.  You are the man with 2 souls.  Alvato was the holy priest, but something happend.  We just need to find...hmmm" Sage peers into the darkness. "allright Jewel, you can come out now"  "Oh father, how did you know I was there."  "Kamain, this is my daughter Jewel."  "kamain, is she as old as you?  i mean, almost 7000 years old?"  Jewel laughs, kamain can clearly see her features, she is about 5'8.  A slender body, well porportiond.  In a blue dress with a blue cloak over it, long black hair with a white lock of hair.

Some guards rushed in. "Sage, the eastern town of Kolpos is under attack by invaders!" Sage, Kamain, Jewel, and Liselle looked at eachother. "We better go see what we can do," said Kamain. Sage and Jewel rushed out the door while Kamain and Liselle trailed behind a distance. "So Liselle, do you think the 4 of us can make a difference to whatevers happening?" Liselle looked down. "Kamain, I like the name LIN better, so don't try to rename me!" Kamain shook his head, "Alright, Lin, let's go."  The 4 arrived into the town to see it in flames. "Awww crap." said Kamain. The 4 turned around to see a giant undead creature advancing to them! Sage sparked a giant red lightning bolt towards the creature, but it hit and had no effect. "What the?..." With that, the giant creature swung its large spikey tail into the side of Sage. "Arghhh!" he screamed as he was knocked out. Kamain , Lin, and Jewel glared upwards towards the towering beast. Jewel said "I can't believe that magic had no effect on it. Lin jumped up high and made a quick slash on the creature, but it did little damage. She yelled, "Kamain, do something fast!" The burning buildings collapsed on the sides of the battle, causing intense heat. Jewel looked for something she could do, but could come up with no plan. The creature grabbed Lin in one hand and threw her at Jewel, effectively knocking them both out, leaving only one standing to battle the beast. Kamain grinned and...

Inside Kamain begins to feel the same stirring as he once before had. His grin fades and then that strange light appears in front of him again. The Undead creature swings with all his might at Kamain and knocks him through the rubble of the once prosperous town of Kolpos. Kamain's magical light fades and he gingerly gets up to his feet. His large enemy balls his hands into fists and swings them high above his head, getting ready to make the finishing blow.  The giant zombie begins to swing his arms down when a loud rumbling yell comes from behind some demolished houses. Kamain stares in horror as the humungous fists get closer to pulverising him. Then, out from behind the debris of builings comes a 10 foot tall Minotaur. He swings a large double bladed axe. With great power, the bull-man brings his axe down, toward the zombie's neck. Kamain feels relieved as the fists of the zombie land- even more dead- next to him, along with the rolling head of the undead creature.

Kamain looked at the Minotaur which suddendly faded away. "This is all getting so confusing...who was that?" Kamain mumbled to himself as he shook his head. He quickly perished his thoughts and checked to see if his friends were alright. Lin and Jewel started to awake, and he saw Sage rise to his feet. Blood from a large cut flowed down Sages cloak. "Hey, are you going to be alright?" asked Kamain. "I must rest, and watch over this village. But first, have this..." A bright light appeared and a powerful looking sword materilazed into Kamain's hands. "Thanks, Sage, but where do we go from here?" asked Kamain. Sage pointed north, "You, Lin, and Jewel shall go north through the caves to the Castle of Ravisk, you'll meet an apprentice of mine there. That weapon I have given to you is the Soul Shattering Sword, Kisakko. Go now, and be aware that other powerful swords shall seek to cross with yours." With that, the 3 headed towards the cave and suddenly found themselves face to face with a beast at the cave entrance. It was the dreaded...

Shiva. The ruler of all ice, was at the entrance of the cave. Guarding it, perhaps? Or maybe she was there to warn travelers. When the heros meet her she gives a low bow. "I am Shiva. I know who you are and you will have my aid in your quest.  Now, we will fight to see if you are powerful enough to continue living. Draw!" She points her finger at Lin and a shard of ice slices through the air. Lin jumps out of the way in time and follows up with a magical barrier of fire.  Kamain yells out, "Wait! We do not wish to-" He stops his protest to avoid getting punched. "Guys! Don't hurt Shiva! She will stop!" He jumps aside to dodge another attack from Shiva. The Ice god screams, "You fools! I said FIGHT!" She fires another ice shard which is melted once it touches the barrier. "Fire- Ah! C'mon! Show me what you've got!" She jumps up into the air and waves her arms around crazily. Suddenly from above, it rains hail the size of baseketballs. Lin gets knocked out from one striking her in the head too hard. Kamain yells in fury and jumps at Shiva with his new sword.  He hits Shiva's shoulder, and water sprays out of the gouge. The slice almost cut her whole arm off, and she reels back in pain. Kamain lands behind her and jumps up again, doing a forward flip, but going backwards through the air. He spins above his icy enemy and cuts her other shoulder. This new wound isn't as fatal as the first one, but just as crippling. She cries out a shriek of agony. Kamain lands with a thud in front of her, and says, "Now, you will stop." Shiva replies, "Yes... I will... stop. But now I... must continue living somewhere else. I will grant... you my powers... just strike me through the heart and your sword will absorb my very soul..." Kamain shakes his head. "Do it now, you- ahh- pitiful fool! Before I kill you!" Kamain hesitates even longer. Sage says, "Kamain, you must take her life for her to live- for any of us to live. Trust me, you'll be doing us all a favor..." Sage begins to speak to himself, "Damn ice woman is getting annoying..." Kamain nods and then jumps at Shiva. He sticks Kisakko through her chest and Shiva falls to her knees, Kamain still grasping the sword that is impaling her. Suddenly, Shiva turns into a blue misty cloud and flows right into the Kisakko.  Kamain turns to look at his friends and sees that Lin is just getting up. She rubs her head and says, "What happened? I always miss the good stuff." Lin kicks the ground as she stands, creating a small dust cloud. "Well, I suppose we continue on in, eh?" Kamain asks, knowing the answer already. They all nod to each other and walk into the cave's mouth. Once getting in so far that Lin needed to create a beam of light, they noticed that the walls were colored a sickly green color and had ancient depictions of battles on them. "Hmmm, very interesting indeed." Sage comments. "They remind me of...

old stories I heard as a child. I belive we will find an answer at the other end of the cave." The other 3 looked at Sage. Jewel noted, "Hey, I thought you were staying at the village." Sage shook his head and replied, "No, I shall continue with you three. But I am weakened from the beast that destroyed the town. Still, I should prove useful while I recover." The others nodded. After traversing into the cave a bit, they were stopped by a large brick wall, that was smothered in flames. "Stand back," said Jewel. She held out her arm and a beam of ice shot into the wall. But it had no effect. "Impossible!" she said. "I fear this wall is protected by a more powerful flame, the flame of hades." Kamain held up his sword, Kisakko, and it glowed with a light blue aura. Kamain dashed the wall and destroyed it with one strike from the sword. The energy radiating from the sword calmed down. Alvato said, "I see you have found one of the many useful powers of Soul Shattering Sword Kisakko." Lin exclaimed, "Damn, that's a long title for a weapon!" With that, the 4 trudged on only to come face to face with the cave's master, the dreaded...
