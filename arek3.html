<br><br><br>

We are now back in Arek’s fortress.  Arek is very excited.  He is sitting in his throne like usual.  It is late afternoon.  Egar is lying on the ground and bored; dozing off.
<br><br>
Arek screams, "The day is finally here!  My black dragons are ready for destruction, HA HAHAHAHA!!!  Today, I will get my vengence!" he looks down at Egar, "Are you excited too?!"
<br><br>
Egar, jumped when Arek yelled, softly replies, "Oh yeah.  Yippee..."
<br><br>
"That’s the spirit!!"
<br><br>
"Arek, Apocalypse Island will have to be visible when the black dragons are dropped on the ground.  And are you sure you had not forgotten anything when you created the dragons?"
<br><br>
"Of course not your human unperfected fool!  What could I have forgotten?"
<br><br>
"Can the dragons survive outside their capsules?"
<br><br>
"Of course they can!  Why couldn’t they?"
<br><br>
"I don’t know, if you’re sure, then that’s okay by me."
<br><br>
"Alright then!  At dusk my dragons will descend upon the world and create chaos! HA HAHAHA!!!"

<br><br>

Priphea are small beautiful flowers.  They flower very rarely.  Jack and Lufia are lying on their sides facing each other.  They’re chatting.
<br><br>
Jack says, "It’s been a wonderful day Lufia.  Thank you for the fine day."
<br><br>
She smiles, "Your welcome.  Thank you too.  I’ve had a fun time this past month."
<br><br>
She sniffs the flowers, "Don’t you just love Priphea flowers?  They bloom so rarely.  When they do, they look and smell beautiful."
<br><br>
Jack smiles, "Yeah, Lufia they do," and Jack pauses.
<br><br>
Lufia asks, "What are you thinking, Jack?"
<br><br>
"Oh, nothing really.  Isn’t great the world is safe?"
<br><br>
"Yes, it is.  I’m glad that I can walk around, without worry."
<br><br>
Their eyes close, but when their faces come closer, and Jack stops because he thought he had heard something.
<br><br>
"Jack?"
<br><br>
He falls back, "Did you hear that?"
<br><br>
"What did you hear?"
<br><br>
Jack hears the sound again.  It sounded like a shriek of a monster.  This time it’s louder, "There, again, did you hear it?"
<br><br>
There’s a third shriek, it was loud enough that Lufia heard, "Yeah, it sound like..."
<br><br>
Jack interrupts her, "A...dragon?  How could that be?  I don’t know of any dragons, why would one come to this village?"
<br><br>
The fourth shriek is loud enough that it makes Jack and Lufia turn towards the front of the city.  And there, in the entrance to the village was a black dragon.
<br><br>
Lufia gasps, "Oh, my!"
<br><br>
Jack comforts her, "I’ll go and see.  Thank goodness I kept his sword with me today.  It’s like a part of me"
<br><br>
"Can I come with you?  I won’t get in the way."
<br><br>
"It’s dangerous!  I can’t..."
<br><br>
"I’ll stand away.  Far enough away from the dragon."
<br><br>
"Alright.  You be careful then!"
<br><br>
Lufia kneels behind a wall, which is 500 yards away from the dragon.  The dragon is huge!  Its a 10 times bigger than a house!  How could this thing be destroyed?
<br><br>
Jack goes up to the dragon ready to fight.  He then notices that the dragon is having a hard time breathing with his lungs.  Its head swerves from side to side, falls back, and all of a sudden, the whole body falls forward.  Jack jumps out of the way.
<br><br>
Jack is very puzzled, he goes up to Lufia, "How did that happen??"
<br><br>
Lufia suggested, "I noticed after every second, it had a harder time breathing.  That is weird certainly."
<br><br>
Then a lady outside her house hanging laundry screams!
<br><br>
Jack and Lufia rush up to her, "Ma’am what is it?"
<br><br>
The lady is stunned and she points her finger upward.  Lufia and Jack look up.  Very high in the sky and very little, you could see an, island!?!
<br><br>
Jack yells, "How could this be possible?!"
<br><br>
At the front of the town, Aguro and Jerin teleport at the entrance to the town.  They see Jack and Lufia.  They run up to them.
<br><br>
Jerin is the first to speak, "Lufia?!?"
<br><br>
Lufia replies, "Yes, that’s me, who are you?"
<br><br>
"I’m Jerin.  One of Jack’s friends."
<br><br>
Jerin then turns to look at Jack.  Jack says, "It’s a long story.  But how did you find me?"
<br><br>
Aguro answered, "Jerin tried teleporting to every town we’ve been to, so we ended up coming here.  I see you have a dragon dead too.  In Lorbenia, so did we."
<br><br>
Jack nods and points Aguro and Jerin to the sky, "Look."
<br><br>
Aguro and Jerin look up and says, "Ohhh, my!"
<br><br>
Aguro then says, "It can’t be!  It looks different though.  We should go check it out.  We still have the airship.  It’s in Lorbenia.  Let’s go up there."
<br><br>
Jack replies, "Yeah...."
<br><br>
Then the island disappears.
<br><br>
Jerin was the first to notice, "Where did the island go?"
<br><br>
The other three look up; it’s gone.
<br><br>
Jack is surprised, "Now that’s weird isn’t it?  Well, there’s nothing we can do about it now, but come see me if you see it again..."

<br><br>

<br><br>

"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!" Arek screams on the top of his lungs, "How?!  Why?!  What went wrong with my dragons!?"
<br><br>
The tele-view is on and showing Arus village.  It shows the dead black dragon, Jack, Aguro, Jerin, and Lufia.
<br><br>
Arek is in his throne and Egar on the floor.  They were both looking at the tele-view.  Arek tries to think.  He had seen that the dragon had hard time breathing.
<br><br>
Egar is also thinking.  He asks Arek, "When you made them, what did you have them breathe?"
<br><br>
"Helium of course, why?"
<br><br>
"There isn’t enough helium in the air down below to breathe and live on."
<br><br>
"WHAT?! #@$%!!  I can’t believe this happened!!"
<br><br>
Arek thinks and growls, "I will be back.  You can count on that Egar.  I will NOT fail next time...WATCH OUT JACK!!!!!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!"
