they turn to the huge Ice block with Lin and Jewel...and it's starting to melt...early. Kamain wonders why it's happening early...Sage explains, "Must be with the extra people here..." And soon enough, Lin and Jewel wiggle free of the remaining ice and colapse on the floor, a little confused. After gaining their ground they both leer at Kamain, the one with the ice skills. Kamain exclaimes, "Whaat?! you two need to cool off, you were about to kill each other!" Jewel replies, "Heheh, yeah I 'spose, I was bearing down on Lin!" Lin pokes in, "Whaat are you talkin' about girl? I'd say it was the other way around!" Jewel replies, "GIRL?! I'm 150 times your age sister!..." This goes on for awhile while Kamain and the other guys just look down with a *sigh* Kamain turns around back to Spectre and McHeart, "So where were we? Oh yeah, Spectre, I'm susposed to do a one-on-one with you know eh?" Kamain steps up to Specre and...

Spectre looks over to Kamain and hisses with delight. "Shall we then? I fight to the death- it is a great thing death. It will take you over not too long from now." Kamain bursts in, "Shut up. I'm tired of this!" Kamain is pissed beyond extreme from perhaps something Spectre had said. Slowly pulling his sword from it's sheath on his hip, Kamain begins to glow a golden color. The Angelic powers within him explode outward in a spray of pure whiteness. When the glare is reduced everyone witnesses Kamain's other self. He is now an angel, wings, halo, and the like. He flaps those extravagant wings of his, and lifts up off of the floor. Spectre begins to mummble and spits out, "What the hell is this?! My dark lord, please save me from this horribly powerful force..." His ravings comtinue under his breath. Angelic Kamain lashes out at the dumbfounded warrior of death. The Kisakko slashes through cloth, flesh, and bone. Spectre falls to the ground in a gory mist of blood. His chest was ripped cleanly open, from right shoulder to left hip. As blood slowly oozes out of his wound, he puts his hands up in a feeble attempt to defend himself. Angelic Kamain holds the Kisakko high above his head, gathering up Holy power into the sword. Thragnar notices a dark shadowy presence in the room and scouts with his eyes. He spots a looming cloud of darkness moving toward Angelic Kamain. Appearantly nobody else has discovered this evil being. Thragnar cautiously unslings his giant axe from his back and begins toward the dark mist. He moves around the current fight, avoiding any chance of being hit. He can feel the heavy wieght of stares coming from a few people. Now behind Angelic Kamain, he jumps furiously at the black cloud. The cloud backs away avoiding Thragnar's swing. The minotaur rolls and hastily stands up as the mist begins to form into a being. It is Alvato- High priest of the Temple of Sage!  Thragnar knows of what happened to this man- that a demon overtook him. Alvato stands up straight, and stares at Thragnar, then to Angelic Kamain who is still gathering up a horendous amount of energy into the sword. Thragnar jumps forward again, swinging but only hitting air. Alvato does a triple-flip jump over the tall minotaur, and lands behind the angel. The most sinsister grin forms on Alvato's face, as he views all those captivated by his presence. Not Thragnar though, he is a brave one. The minotaur leaps once again at the possessed Alvato, but misses again. Alvato jumps up into the air, and rips the Kisakko free from Angelic Kamain's grasp, who does not seem to care and begins to beat at Spectre with his fists. Alvato lands gracfully with the Soul Shattering Sword, facing the two fighters, Thragnar to the right of them, the crowd to the left. One more of the fiendish grins, and then the demonic Alvato holds out the Kisakko, charged to the brim with an explosive blast of deadly energy. It is pointed right at Kamain! Thragnar turns and runs toward Kamain, but everything is going really slow. He sees the demon, who is still grinning, Kamain who's fists slam into Spectre in slow motion, and the group of his allies. They all stand, lockind in stares of disbelief, horror, or even maybe excitement. Thragnar cares not. He runs toward Kamain, hoping to knock him out of the way, but realizes he only has time for this one option. Thragnar howls in fury, but keeps his focus. Throwing down his large weapon, Thragnar bounds one mighty leap, right into the path of the ray of deadly light flowing forth from Kisakko. He absorbs most of the damage, disintegrating into nothing. Kamain is blasted, but is hit only by the tip of the iceberg. He is flung through the room, busting through a wall, and falling in the adjacent room. Spectre looks up and yells, "Dark Lord! You have come to save me! I th-!" He is cut short by Alvato who swung the Kisakko at Spectre's neck. As Spectre's head rolls to a stop on the floor, Alvato trudges toward Angelic Kamain. Two souls roam the room, that of Thragnar's and that of Spectre's. The souls are absorbed into the Kisakko. Thragnar's is that of the earth power, and Spectre's of Dark. Lin, Sage and Jewel stand staring at the demon, afraid and confused. McHeart growls out loud, and runs toward Thragnar's axe. He hefts it easily. The aged man yells out, "I will kill you! For Thragnar!!" With his last words he charges at Alvato, who turns around to meet his agressor. McHeart swings, and is parried by the Kisakko. Two more swings parried, McHeart pulling a fast number with such a heavy weapon. The clash of steel echos through the room. Then in a sickening sound and spray of red liquid, Alvato's left arm is cleft right off. In response he flings the Kisakko, away, and kicks McHeart in the gut. McHeart falls backwords, flings the axe out of his hand. Kisakko falls to the ground, and stabs into the wooden floorboards. Thragnar's axe slides up right next to the sword, bloodstained and beaten. Alvato turns around to attend to his first priority, when suddenly he is being torn at by some sort of spell. A stream of dangerous fire sprays out from Sage's hands, and melts away at Alvato's back. With the wave of his hand, the roof above Sage, Lin, and Jewel caves in. It falls on them, and knocks them all out. McHeart cries out in pain as he tries to talk, "You won't get away with this!" McHeart's chest area is completely crushed-caved in just like the roof. "It's a wonder you can still talk old man." Answers Alvato. "I have become much stronger and have come to claim my prize. You should feel great- you will be the only one to witness this amazing step in history!" Alvato shakes with abnormal quakes, and a black mist flows out of his grinning mouth. The cloud floats toward Kamain, and the shell of Alvato slumps to the floor, dead beyond saving. McHeart tries desperatly toget up, but only falls to the floor, unable to do anything. Angelic Kamain gets up and brushes himself off. His gaze transfixes on the cloud, and he balls up his fists. With a sudden burst, the cloud plunges right into Kamain's chest. Kamain rocks just as Alvato did. Kamain's Angelic form receeds and makes way for the demonic form. Bat-like wings, horns and long talons. The only thing that stays Angelic is a light in Kamain's right eye- which is the angel Love's last hold inside of Kamain. "Hahaha! I have achieved greatness." Howls Possessed Kamain.  "Silly angel. You think you are putting up a stand in that small part of our host. What you do not understand is that you really are trapped! Hahahaha!" And with that, Kamain disappears. Sage, Lin and Jewel are the survivors, laying unconscious under the fallen roof. Hours later... Sage wakes up inside of an unfamiliar room, on a bed. He rises and looks around. Lin and Jewel are in the same room on identical beds. The room is dark, and there is one candle in the center. Sage can make out the outlines of a door straight in front of him. He shakes the sleepiness out of himself, and begins to get out of his small bed. A figure steps out from one of the dark corners, but Sage takes no defense, he can sense it is a friend. He looks at the form of a young man, as he steps into the light. In a young, boyish voice he says, "Good to see you are all right." Sage inquires, "I don't mean to be rude in my bluntness... but, who are you?" A smile forms on the young man's lips and he takes another step into the light. He is younger, has golden blonde shoulder-lenght hair, parted at the top, a youthful face, left ear full of silver earrings, and the most sky-blue eyes ever seen. "I can understand. I am Velius. Age of 15. And... younger brother of Kamain. You are still in McHeart's Chataeu." Sage yawns and replies, "Velius Kelineva, huh?"

"Velius Kelineva, I am Sage. Over there on that bed- he points to the place that Jewel lays- is my daughter, Jewel. And to my left is one of Kamain's friends, Lin. And... she is a princess."  Velius gives a look of humor, and replies, "I already know who you all are, including McHeart and Thragnar- rest thier souls. Now it is up to You, Jewel, Lin and me to decide what to do next. We must get my brother back- that much is obvious- but how will we go about it?" They contemplate for a moment, then suddenly, without any warning, Velius walks out the door. Sage gingerly follows, wondering what this mysterious young man is doing. Ahead, Velius walks through the hallway and enters the battle-worn training room. He strides up to the two weapons that lie next to each other. Thragnar's axe reflects a large beam of light at the Kisakko. The Soul-Crushing Sword glimmers in the pale moonlight flooding in through the hole in the roof, and speckles the walls with light reflected off of the axe. Velius walks up to these two weapons. He reaches down with his right arm and easily grabs up the large axe. "Body-Crushing Axe, Thranloom, grant me thy power!" He announces as he holds it up into the cool air. Next Velius reaches out for the sword. Swinging the thin blade up, he shouts out, "Soul-Shattering Sword, Kisakko, grant me thy power!" The young boy begins to glow a redish-white color, just as the moon of this world does when it is full. Sage stands back in amazment.

"How does one so young command so much power?" Sage wonders to himself. Velius looks over to McHeart who is entering the room. McHeart angrily yells, "You are a fool, young Velius.  Absorbing weapon energy isn't going to get your brother back." Velius looks over and says, "I figure if we can defeat the devil, Kamain should come back." McHeart coughs, "Hah, a respectable plan, but I doubt you 4 have the power to do it. I'd help, but I am too weak from my last battle." Velius laughs and looks at Sage, Lin, and Jewel and says : "Lets go!" The party starts marching off, but is cut off by an "ahem." Velius angrily looks around and says, "YES?...huh, wait a second...who are you?" A figure is standing next to McHeart. He wears a wide cape and a black robe. He is equipped with a powerful looking metallic staff with strange designs on the top. Jewel and Sage look at him and Sage says, "You...you're the Dark Preist, Beao!" Beao speaks, "Hmmm...that's correct, and my old apprentice Mr. McHeart says that you may need some..assistance." Jewel says, "Yes, we could surely use your help!" Lin whispers to Jewel, "A Dark Preist, doesn't sound like a good guy!" Jewel smacks Lin in the back of the head, "You fool! Just because someone is extremely powerful in black magic doesn't make them evil!" Lin rubs the back of her head and says, "Great..." Sage speaks out, "Beao is to be trusted, Be happy he is lending us his power for our cause. He sees the infinte war within Kamain as a threat to the great balance of power. Let us head to the next town and ask the people if they have seen anything." Beao walks behind as the group of 5 (Velius, Sage, Lin, Jewel, and Beao) head off on the road towards the next town...

"So, uh, Beao... Where do you come from?" Asks Lin. Beao lifts an eyebrow in some disply of confusion. "Me?" He slowly replies. "I... I was... I don't know." Sage explodes at Lin, "Do not bring up his past! What are you thinking?! Don't discuss such silly things with Master Beao!" Beao interjects, "No- It is fine. I myself sometimes wonder where I came from, and I have to face the facts some time. I can't run away forever." Sage hastily appoligizes. Lin prompts further, "Why don't you know? What happened?" Beao begins to answer her questions as best he can, but suddenly changes his thought. "Where are we going next?" Sage begins, "In my humble opinion, I think we should go to Freyart. I know an-" Lin interjects, "An Elf that lives there in the large city. He would know something about demon exsorcizm. Father believes that if we find him and get his information that we will be able to exorsize the demonic spirit out of Kamain. Am I correct Daddy?" Sage looks totally out-of-it, and just answers with a nod. Velius starts, "Yes, good idea Jewel. We should go to Freyart to seek the help of this..." Sage is reanimated and begins to say something, but his daughter once again interupts. "Roq. Row-K. His name is Roq. Got it? He is an elf and he lives in Freyart and..." Jewel's voice continues through the entire trip.

The party heads down the road towards Aracadia, when suddenly, a small army of around 30 bandits confronts them. The bandit group is about 100 yards forward. Everyone looks concerned about being outnumbered so badly. "Out of our way." Beao coldy says to them. "You will show us respect, and hand over any riches you may have!! We are the great Bandits of Doom!!!" Lin starts laughing out loud and a sweatdrop rolls down the bandit leader's head. "Man, what a cheesey name! Bandits of Doom? Ahahahaha!" All of the bandits start getting pissed and draw all of their daggers/swords/axes. Beao calmy sticks out his hand. A catastrophic dark energy wave explodes from the center of the bandits, overtaking them all. The dark energy explosion nearly reaches to Beao himself, who looks less than concerned. The party trudges onward, stepping on the battered "Bandits of Doom" lying in the middle of the road. Jewel notes, "What a pitiful bunch...heehee." Various "ouch" and "argh"s can be heard from the defeated bunch. As the crew is about to reach Freyart when...

A large spectre of a minotaur confronts them. It raises from a crouched position, and when it reaches full hieght, everyone exclaims, "Thragnar!" But it is not the real minotaur, only his ghost. It begins, "Hello, my dear friends. Velius, you must guide these people in the way your brother did." Velius nods. "I have come to you as a ghost this one last time to bear this one last message. It is a hint given to me from the a fellow spectre. It is from Aulder, the eldest of the Angelic gods. He says this: 'You may fond help from the Elf, but it is not the solution.' I do not know more. I am sorry I cannot help any longer..." Velius yells at Thragnar, "No! You saved my brother's life, and McHeart's too! You were a great and noble warrior, and I'm am positive your Minotaur Clan would be proud of you. I am proud to say I knew you. Thank you for all you have done." Thragnar bows his head deeply and answers, "Yes, and you are a great warrior yourself. I see you have my mighty axe. How did you know it's name though? I never told anyone except- McHeart. I see. Thank you, too, for carrying on my legacy, young, brave, masterful Velius. Good bye my friends..." With that the Minotaur's ghost slips away into the winds.

The party sulks down the road. They are clearly troubled by the loss of their friend Thragnar. "Who was that minotaur?" asks Beao. Lin tells the story of what happened. Beao comments, "I see, tremendous courage. He knew that the prescence of the angelic Kamain could help destroy a greater evil." They all nod and continue. Sage asks Lin, "So, what do you expect in Freyart?" Lin replies, "Not quite sure. I just hope it can help us find the demon Kamain and revert him back to his old self." But right then, an evil laugh from above breaks the silence. "What? Who are you?" asks Jewel to the figure floating above. "Hahahaha....my name is Verigal Deci. I have been ressurected as a follower to the devil, Lord Kamain. With each breathe you draw, his dark persona becomes more and more powerful! I have to come to take your lives so that you may not interfere with the process." Deci floats down to an aggresive crouch. He has various body sculpted armor which allows flexibility. A fabric is wrapped around the bottom of his face, looking much like a ninja. "I've had quite enough sleep, 3 centuries to be exact...prepare yourselves!" With that, Verigal Deci dashes forward with blinding superhuman speed. He cuts deep into Jewel before anyone can react, causing a deep wound. Jewel, stunned, sinks to her knees. "Velius, you, Sage, and Lin take care of this guy! I shall attend to Jewel's wound." says Beao. "I don't think so!" yells Deci as he flings a barrage of flaming shurikens towards Beao, who deflects them by spinning his metallic staff very quickly. Velius approaches Deci with his axe. Velius makes a powerful lunge which barely misses Deci. "Nice try, but my speed is too great!" says Deci as he makes a slash with his Katana towards Velius. As it approaches Velius's head, two giant fireballs casted by Sage and Lin slam in Deci. But he stands uneffected, with small fires burning on his clothes. "Your pathetic magic cannot harm me." taunts Deci. "Let's UP the power then!" says Sage, "Atmosfry!" A large red electrical field forms and absorbs in Deci, who is knocked back. He slowly gets up "Argh...Invisible!" With Verigal Deci's spell, light waves bend around him, causing him to dissapear. "Cast a spell!" yells Velius. "Can't...don't know where he is to hit him." reorts Lin. Velius walks forward and faces Lin. "He could strike us in the back at any second...hmmm?" With that Velius spins around and does a wide slash at thin air! Blood sprays out and Deci reappears, with a gaping wound. "Dammit...I'll be back! *Cough*" with that, Deci dissapears. "Are you guys finished? We are almost to Freyart." says Jewel. "Hey, you' are back already?" asks Sage. "Yes, apparently black magic isn't Beao's only power, although his strongest." "Great, let's get a move on..." says Lin as they head off into the woods.

So the party move on into the Arwood forest. It is pretty much an ordinary forest. They have to make camp a few times to get through it. Along the way, the party ponders about what's happened to Kamain. Something that Sage wonders is how the devil has taken most of Kamain, while the angel has only a little part. What has made the devil stronger than the angel? Before when they were in Kamain's body, they had a 50/50 relationship in him, but now the angel (seems) to be trapped and overpowered by the devil. Sage then concludes they will find out soon, maybe from that elf in Freyart. After a few days, the party sucessfully reach the other end of the forest and reach Freyart. When they reach the castle walls, there is a small problem...

"Halt!!" yells a voice from on top of the castle, "Your party will turn around or DIE!" Everyone looks at eachother. "What have we done?" asks Sage. Another voice says, "You seem to have kicked my friend's ass, and he doesn't care for you that much." The two cloaked figures jump down from the castle wall right in front of the party. "Haha...you." says Beao. "That's right!" yells one figure as he tears off his cloak, revealing himself to be... "Verigal Deci!" shouts Jewel. "That's right. Now I shall smash you all!" The other figure is still cloaked and says, "I have a better idea. Deci, you and Jewel shall go one-on-one." Deci starts laughing, "Hahahaha! That's too damn easy!" Jewel steps forward to challenge him. "I owe you from that cheap shot when we last met! Guys, stay back, he's mine!" With that Jewel jumps high up and...

Gets nailed in the midsection with a long pole. She is flung back to the ground, in a coughing heap. Everyone eyes the other cloaked figure, the one with the pole grasped in his hands. "You can add another cheap shot to your list, pathetic woman!" The cloaked figure laughs hysterically, and follows up with, "But remember who gave it to you, eh? Tis' I!" The cloak is torn from the figure, revealing a very familiar person. "Spectre! I bet you thought I was dead, eh? Well, too bad for you all that I'm not! I have teamed up with my pal Deci here to kick all ya' all's asses 'round for a little while." Deci laughs and adds, "Maybe til' you're dead, maybe til' we're tired. Who knows?" They both laugh in unison and Spectre yells out, "Time to find out!" They both lunge at Jewel. She rolls back, dodging Deci's sword, but gets whacked by Spectre's Pole. Spectre goes in for another strike, but is blown away by a ball of dark energy hurled from the tip of Kisakko. Spectre gets knocked back 10 feet or so and instanly Velius asks, "If you are truly Spectre, then why is it that I am able to use your spirit's power of darkness? Your spirit is in here for sure!" Deci laughs in his high-pithced voice, and answers him, "Spectre has been resurected to serve Lord Kamain, foolsie man!" Deci jumps toward Poilgra again, only this time Jewel isn't prepared. Deci reaches out with his blade, but gets railed off track by Thranloom, the Body-Crushing Axe (Velius whipped it at the lunging Deci). Velius charges Deci as he begins to shove the heavy weapon from his broken leg. Deci quickly looks up and sees the attack, but can only hold his arm out to block. In a spray of gore, Deci's right arm gets cut off at the elbow. Velius begins another attack but is knocked backwards by Spectre's pole. "Damn you! My arm! Damn it! I will kill you with my bare..." He begins to calm, but explodes in laughter, finishing off with, "Hand! I will kill you with my bare hand! Hahahahaha!" Deci and Spectre laugh together.
