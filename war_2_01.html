Suddenly, Sage steps up. "Impale!" large spikes rise from the ground, but Spectre teleports outta the way and knocks Sage out cold with his fist. Spectre starts teleporting like crazy, confusing everyone. Velius makes a couple of missing slashes, and gets counter attacked by a kick to the back of the head. Lin thrusts her arm forward, "Enshou Wall!" A large white-hot beam tears across the ground into Deci, who is backed into a corner. "Come on, Spectre, don't you want to help your friend?" taunts Lin. With that Spectre teleports directly over Lin's head, and comes down with a crushing sword attack...a large clanging sound is heard. Velius deflected the attack. "Fire Wave!" chants Jewel as flames smother Spectre. "That was painful, but it didn't quite do the trick." retorts Spectre. With that, he instantly teleports and swiftly kicks both Lin and Jewel in their stomachs as he is hovering. He grabs them by the hair and bashes their heads together, they are knocked out. "Little Velius is left, huh?" with that Deci gets up and does a clumsy overhead attack towards Velius, which is blocked. But the attack was a lure, as Spectre dashes in and slams his pole into Velius's back, rendering him out. "Pathetic." says Spectre, looking down. "Wait, wasn't there one more of them? Where is he?" A voice echoes from behind them, "Yes, I am left. Why don't you two leave?" The two start laughing at Beao's comment. "Have it your way then. Evil Flare!" A large devasting explosion rocks Verigal Deci and Spectre. They are flung apart. Deci is out from the spell.  Spectre has some fight in him and rapidly dashes towards Beao. Spectre's forehead meets Beao's metallic staff, and he's out like a light. Suddenly, Deci and Spectre are teleported away and everyone starts to awaken and...

Beao yells, "What the hell! You guys can't stand up for yourselves? ...I am not bragging, but you all need to gain more power. I cannot stay with you forever. Only until you are strong enough to fend for yourselves at least." Veluis gingerly stands up, and retorts, "I wasn't just instantly able to lift the Thranloom! It takes many years of strength training to reach a Minotaurs power! What more can I do?" Lin mumbles, "Pull a magic trick out of your ass..." Beao shouts, "Never the less, that was, as they said, 'pathetic'. Velius, you must strive to be your best- not just better than Kamain. Lin-Princess, you must stop holding back because you are afraid that you will show you are weak. You aren't. Jewel I swear the last time I saw you you were this tall- er, you need to not be so naive." Beao shifts his heavy gaze over to Sage. "Sage. You must be a better team member." Lin is obviously pissed, and snaps back, "And just who are you to be judging us?! You only just now-" Beao cuts her off, "Those two were only playing with you all. They would not have faired so well had you worked better as a team. Velius- you are pretty goos with teamwork... but not so for the rest of you. ANYway we need to see that elven man in this 'Freyart' place." They all give eachother annoyed glances- results of Beao's talk. Then they proceed into the large open doors, past the entrance, and through into the huge and confusing town of Freyart.

Velius asks, "So, where does this guy live?" Lin retorts, "Hell if I know." Everyone turns to Beao and looks at him. He responds, "Why are you all looking at me? I don't even know what you're looking for." Jewel looks around confused. "This is a pretty large town, we need to find Roq's house pretty quickly, before someone attacks us again." Coincidently, an assortment of laughs are heard from behind the party, and they all turn around to meet a fully healed Verigal Deci, Spectre, and another figure with his hand on his sheathed sword. "Oh great...they'll keep coming back, adding one more each time!" says Lin. "Deci, Spectre, and who're you?" asks Sage of the 3rd member of the bad guy's party. "Don't worry about me, or my name. Prepare to taste my blade." The stranger unsheathes his sword and it glows with an eerie black energy. "Dammit, we don't have time for another big fight!" says Velius. "Indeed..." comments Beao as he charges up energy. Deci, Spectre, and the mysterious swordsman step forward, and they look pissed. "Displacement Wind!!" shouts Beao as a vicous pressurized gust of wind blows the strangers outside of the time. "You two hurry up and find Roq, maybe I'll catch up to you later. I'm gonna go take on those guys outside the town. Good luck!" says Beao. Velius nods and says, "Be careful, and goodbye." With that, Beao teleports into an unknown battle with the 3 bad guys, buying time for the party. Anyways, Velius, Lin, Jewel, and Sage run towards the tavern to get some information, but when they get there...

The bar is completly empty, save for the tender, and one single man in a cloak off in a corner. "We should still ask around." Says Velius. The man in the corner gets up and turns toward them. It is the mysterious swordsman from earlier. "I cannot be deterred so easily. Although I could kill you all right here, I will let you live because it would not present a challenge- something I rarely find." Velius promtps, "So where did Spectre and his buddy pick you up?" "Ah..." He starts. "I won't tell you anything about myself. But I can tell you where to find Roq. He lives two blocks north of here, and has a large shop with the most obvious sign hanging from the wall. You can't miss it."

Lin asks the swordsman, "Hey, wait a sec. Who's side are you on here? Are you trying to stop the devil Kamain?" The swordsman puts his back to the group and unsheaths part of his sword. The black energy starts radiating out of the blade while the swordsman stays silent. Sage asks, "What happened to Beao? How did his battle fare?" The mysterious swordsman says, "Hmph...you'll find out later I suppose." Velius gets angry and steps forward and yells, "I don't like your attitude, dammit!" The mysterious swordsman slowly turns around and squints his eyes, staring down Velius. "Be careful, Velius," says Sage. Lin and Jewel step off to the side. The swordsman speaks in a low voice, "Your axe, it is powerful. Yet you stand no chance against me. Do not seek to battle me, yet." Surprised, Velius asks, "Who are you?" With that last question, the mysterious swordsman vanishes from the room. The crew, confused, walks outside. They notice a large side that says "Roq's Speciality Store." They walk inside and are greeted by...

A tall, slim, long-eared elf. His complection slightly green. He smiles- a thin line bordered by purple lips. His black eyes shine in the outside light, partially covered by some sort of purple mascara. His hair is slicked back, but ends in a short curl, being the shade of purple to match his other features. The elf is standing behind a desk inside of a small, dark shop. Each wall is covered from floor to ceiling with maps and pictures of various places. Velius leads the group up to the counter, where he stops and regards the elf. "Who are you?" The elf's smile dissapears, and he replies, "What's it to ya'?" Velius asks another question, "Are you Roq?" But still he does not get a strait answer. "Why do you want him?" Sage peeps up, "We require his assistance." This time a definite answer, "I am he. What do you need?" Lin starts, as she jumps out from behind Jewel, "Hey, Roq! Long time!" Roq holds out his arms and greets his frined, "Lin! How's it going? So good to see you!" Lin walks up to the desk and continues, "It is great to see you, but we need your help bad. A friend of mine has been... posessed by a demon. We need the demon gone and our friend back in good condition." Roq nods and replies, "Well, I'd love to come help you and your friend out! This map shop is getting boring- I need another mission!" He hops over the counter and starts walking toward the door. "Let's get acuainted on the road. You also need to tell me anything you know about this demon." He stops and turns around. "What you tell me determines where the demon might like to stay." Then Roq leaves the shop, turning around waiting for everyone else to leave. Once all are out, he closes the door and locks it. Velius says, "If you travel with us you will need a weapon for sure." Roq answers by holding up his hand. Suddenly his fingernails extend, looking like long razor-sharp daggers. "I'm always ready!" Roq yells.

As everyone is walking down the road, Lin asks, "SOOO....where exactly are we going?" Velius notes, "Not sure. Roq, do you know?" Roq looks up towards the sky and mumbles, "The demon aspect will surely make his prescence known. Even now, as time goes bye, more of his old servants return to the mortal coil...I figure we might meet up with one in the next town." Sage says, "That's quite a guess. Why do you say this?" Roq looks over at Sage and says, "That's because these evil-types always try to cause mischief, heheh." Jewel laughs and says, "Hehe, makes sense. Suddenly, a figure jumps out in front of the party on road! Everyone draws their weapons until Lin says, "Stop!" The man is young, with a blue robe and armor underneath it. He holds nasty looking katana in his right hand, while energy circles randomly on his left hand. He speaks, "Lin, I have come to check up on you. How has you're training been going?" Lin walks up to him and says, "Alright, I guess. The only energy displacement technique I have learned so far is Enshou Wall though, along with a couple of elemental spells." Velius walks up to Lin and asks, "Who is this guy?" Lin replies, "His name is Garis, he's a master Sword Mage. I'm one of his apprentices." Everyone nods. Garis speaks, "Famos has been seeking you out, he's quite powerful now. I just wanted to...warn you." Lin grits her teeth, "Damn, I knew that he'd catch up sooner or later. But I think I can defeat him. Jewel asks Sage, "Think those two are big-time enemies, Lin and this Famos guy?" Sage replies, "I'm guessing he's one of Garis's apprentices also. You see, all Sword Mage apprentices must become rivals. It's a vicious ladder to the top." Everyone looks at Garis. "That's correct. I must go now, farewell Lin," says Garis as he dashes away. Lin becomes nervous as the party continues down the road...

After much talk of Kamain... "I know a good place to look based on the decription you gave me of Kamain. Although..." ROq trails off. Sage yells, "Although what!?" Shocked Roq continues, "Although, old man, it is on another continent. On a continent to the south named Terriv. It is a calm and serene place- the perfect spot to cause hell. It seems that this would be the most likely spot based on my analysis of what his strategy would be according to the personality of the two of them combined. Whew. But the big problem is getting there. The only boats that can get to that continent are in the region of Dementia-Dane. Ever heard of the harbor town of Heeter? It is full of thieves, gangs, and evil. T'would be in our best interest to go there and be extremely careful." Sage is frowning.  "You sure talk too much." He says. Jewels smacks her father for his rudeness. "Continue." She ploys. With a nod, Roq continues. "In the town of Heeter we will find advanced technology of all sorts- including new types of boats. They run on a mixture of- and don't tell anyone about this, 'cause it is secret info- a mix of water, oil, and human blood. I don't understand it- I'm just telling the facts.  Anyway... if we can stow away on one of those ships bound for Terriv. If one isn't going there, then, uh, we have to steal it! No biggie. I done plenty of boat-jacking jobs in my life. You all agree to my plan?" Velius begins to nod his appoval. Then does Jewel and Lin. Sage though, is not. He opposes the idea with an arched eyebrow. "Whaaaaat?!" Screeches Roq. "Only that Dementia-Dane is an evil place. Do you woman forget how bad a time we had just getting past the border?! Let alone navigating the swamp-infested areas just before the damned caverns and castle of Deamonile! Do you both forget?! I'm sure if Kamain were here he would not be so naive!" This last comment spawns similar looks of disapproval on everyone's face. "...Wait... actually he would." Finishes Sage.  "Fine. Let's go. But hey! What about Beao!!?" Roq smiles and says, "He is better than you right? He can take care of himself. Let's move." Sage mumbles, "Shortest thing you've said all day. Cocky elf."  The border of Dementia-Dane is guarded heavily by massive walls and manned cannon towers. The last time the party travveled into the Dementia-Dane region it was a bit less tight on the security level. They are most likely guarding more heavily due to the parties last visit here. This time around though, the team will have to go by the defensive line using certain tactics. That of brute strength, stealth, or trickery. "All in favor of storming them say 'I'!" Roq says. He looks up over the large rock they hide behind to see the large 20 foot tall walls made of stone. This area is one of the checkpoints where located is a gateway into the Dementia-Dane region. In front of the large wood and metal doors stands a group of guards. They are all lizardians- humans that have reptilian looks and certain qualities. They are overall stupid, strong, and plentiful in numbers. This group of 10 guarding the gate is lined up in front of it as a larger lizardian, obviosly a higher up on the rankings, strolls past each one of his troops. He eyes them all as he passes. Each lizardian stands perfectly still and strait with hands to its sides, chin up, sword on back, and eyes staring forward. They do not notice Roq, as he is a skilled thief, and therefor has special abilities that most of his class do not achieve. The elf ducks back down and looks at Sage, Lin, Velius and Jewel. Velius is whispering of flowers to Lin. Roq snaps his fingers, attracting thier attention. "Really though, if we do a strait-forward attack they will not last long. Lizards are stupid creatures... although I have never seen them so militaristic. It is strange." Sage speaks, "Shh. Keep it down or we will be found... The reason they are so 'different' is most likely because Hatred has got his tainted grip on this land and hence has heavily barricaded it and with such troops. I belive they are perfect soldiers. Even though you are right in saying that the stupidity of a lizardian is no more than that of a drunken orc." Roq sits down and leans against the large rock shielding them from the un-blinking eyes of the lizardian troopers. "What do we do then?" Says Roq, exasperated. Velius peeps up, "I thought maybe we could trick them with some scheme. I mean they are stupid lizards are they not?" Sage once again answers with the same monotone voice, "They aren't normal lizardians. I'm telling you there is something about them." Velius starts, "Then we will somehow distract them and get in a suprise attack. What else can we do against something that has a superior military strategic mind? Like they really do... C'mon. Let's kick some lizard ass." Shaking his head Roq says, "Sage is right- they are not just normal. I sensed it with my 'Scan' ability. Trust me. I've known Sage, Jewel and Lin, and they I'm sure trust me. My looks may have changed a lot but I'm still the same Roq." Velius says, "Yeah, I trust you if Lin does." Both Lin and Roq say, "Good." at the same time. Roq continues on to say, "We do have to get past them somehow.  So we best decide. I think a suprise attack would be the best. I can use my 'Shadow' technique to get in an assassination, then we could go from there." Velius pulls Kisakko out of the scabbard and holds it out. "My sword has only Shiva's Ice element and Thragnar's Earth element in it. Apparently when I defeat an opponent its soul gets sucked into here. If that person is revived then the soul inside my sword vanishes. And that means that I can no longer use the power thier soul gave me. With Ice I can freeze the captain and that might confuse them. Ya' know- they wouldn't get thier orders." Sage begins, "Very genuis. After that then I will impale the frozen statue of the captain that way there would be no way he'd be coming back. Jewel- you turn into a strong animal. And Lin you can use your sword to fight. We must be very carful though." Roq stands up slowly and begins to become invisible. "Let's get this thing started. When the first victim falls that is your signal to Ice one of the bastards." With that Roq's presence is with them no longer. He cautiously moves toward the wall. Once he reaches it he walks along it til' he gets to the gateway doors. He unsheathes his dagger. Roq reaches up and grabs a lizardian under its lower jaw, lifts the head back as to expose the throat, and makes a large slice. Its head comes clean off and falls to the ground next to its dead body. At the same instant Roq becomes visible and attacks the next nearest lizardian, who parries it. The head-lizardian turns to see what is going on and is suddenly frozen. The next instant, a large spike comes up from the ground and juts right for the sculpture looking lizardian. When it makes contact, the spike disappears and the frozen enemy is shattered into tiny bits. Sage jumps out from the right side of the rock, spells ready. Lin jumps out from the left side, sword ready. A large werewolf jumps over the rock, and as it goes over the rock, and begins to descend, Velius appears on top of the rock. He stands with his axe held up above his head, and sword held to the side. Roq looks over to him after dodging a swing and sees the small grin on Velius' face. Of the 8 lizardiands left, 2 charge Roq, 2 charge Lin, 2 Sage, and the last 2 run at the werewolf that is Jewel. Velius hurls his axe at one of the lizardians attacking Roq. It flies strait for the one on the right. But the lizardian that was chosen as the target turns around suddenly and jumps back. The axe imbeds itself deep into the ground. Just when the lizardian looks up, Velius comes speeding down. In a spray of gore Velius lands in front of the lizardian, with his sword out. The lizard's right arm- the arm that was holding its only weapon- falls to the ground. It screeches in pain, and Velius spins around and swings, chopping the creature in twain at the waist. He turns, putting his back against the huge doors. Roq and his enemy keep parrying each other. Lin dodges the flurry of attacks from her two partners. Sage gets pushed to the ground right next to one of the lizardians he smoked. Jewel is playfully batting around the single, unarmed lizardian she is left with. "Sage needs my help most." Velius decides as he runs toward his mage friend. Sages current enemy-in-battle is readying for the decapitating blow. He swings but hits only air as Sage had just changed into a small rat. He begins to scurry away on his four small legs, but the now much bigger lizardian steps on his tail and begins to swing. The lizard-creature's arm falls next to Sage, cut clean off by the deadly Kisakko. Velius kicks the lizardian over, away from Sage and finishes it off. Sage changes back into a human. There are four of the lizardians left- if you count the one being tortured by Jewel. Lin yells for help as her arm gets cut for a second time. Both Sage and Velius immediatly run to help. Jewel looks down at her shaking enemy. "Damn. I was having fun." She mumbles as she bites her victim's head off and heads toward Lin.

Roq is still battling the same one. Is swings around at him from every direction, but only gets parried by Roq's long dagger. An overhead swing from the lizardian comes next. "I've had enough." Says Roq. He blocks the attack with his dagger and points his finger at the lizardians face. Suddenly the fingernail on Roq's left hand, index finger grows. It shoots all the way through the lizard's head right between its eyes. Roq wills his fingernail to shorten, and it does so. He turns to see Velius stab a burning lizardian in the lower back, and then finish it off by pulling the Kisakko up, along its spine. Lin gets cut on her arm again, but this time the wound is deep. The lizardian that gave her the scratch jumps back- right into Jewel's large paws, as she is still in werewolf form. She begins to tear it apart from there. Lin looks down at the gash on her arm and slowly moves her sword over it. As the sword, Fight Fantasy, passes over her wound it closes up. She smiles and remarks, "I knew it." Sage is puzzled. "Wha?" He says. Lin explains, "I gained some limited healing abilites from those enemies." Roq comes up behind them and hastily says, "And even though she did not slay one of the foul creatures, she still gained the power because Kisakko slew one of them- hence giving them both the power. I know many things." Sage speaks, "Yeah but you weren't even with us when Kamain granted her sword power!" Roq simply replies, "Yes, yes. A small detail." Everyone's jaws drop execpt for Lin's and Roq's. They instead grin at each other. Velius, with a careless voice, says, "Yeah, whatever. You told him Lin." Lin and Roq's smiles slowly disappear. "Lets get past this gate, crew." He finishes.  Jewel changes back into a human. Velius waltzes up to the gigantic doors made of wood, and banded with metal. With Thranloom in right and Kisakko in left, he calls upon the powers of earth inside of both weapons. Note that because Thranloom was Thragnar's weapon, it would naturally have the elemental property of earth in it. Both weapons begin to glow dark green, and vibrate.  "Yeaaaahh!" Velius yells as he swings both weapons toward the door. Neither weapon touches the massive doors, but instead, a large column of rock spurts up from the ground in front of the party, and crashes into the doors. The doors burst outward- toward the group- instead of inward like they would have naturally done. When the dust settles, fires can be seen on the back of the door, and beyond the open portal of the door. "What the..?" Murmurs Velius. Through the open doorway floats a commonly known figure. "Ifrit!" Yells Sage. "How could you possibly be here?!" The fire god, Ifrit, laughs and says, "Shut up, manfool! I have been assigned as guardian of these gates that protect the borders of Dementia-Dane. Dementia-Dane is my home. And no pathetic human will ever enter through its sacred doors!" With that said, Ifrit floats to the ground rather speedily and charges up a large fire blast. "Spread out!" Yells Roq. Sage stays where he is at- strait in front of the god.  Velius and Lin go right and spread out between the walls and Sage. Roq and Jewel take the left, totally surrounding Ifrit, save for around his back, where the open doors into the Dementia-Dane region are.  A large blast of flame erupts from Ifrit's hands and beams right for Sage. "Calm Barrier!" He yells, holding his hands out. The glimmer of a curved orb around Sage can be faintly seen. When the fire blast strikes this invisible barrier, all the flames get diverted away from thier original path, and completly miss Sage. "My turn." Says the mage. "Deadly... Ahhhh... Mess-an-ger!" From Sage's fingers comes forth black ghosts, that combine into one great ebony mass. The mass keeps growing, until it is about the size of Ifrit. Sage pushes the darkness toward the fire god with his mind. It slowly creeps toward him. Jewel turns herself into a winged demon and advances on Ifrit. Roq and Velius do the same. Lin stands back as her sword begins to glow light blue. Ifrit laughs once again and watches as the mass of black floats so slowly torward him. He smacks Roq and Velius away with his hands. Jewel jumps up on his chest, and begins to bite, but is easily hurled away.  "Damn you!" She howls as she spins through the air, and then lands on her four legs. The fire god laughs at Sage, who is grinning. Lin whips her sword at Ifrit and he suddenly stops laughing, and starts screaming in pain. "Shiva's powers are with you!"  He yells as he looks at Lin. "I will rid the world of Shiva!" Ifrit begins to charge up another fire spell but only gets halfway through. He is flung into the arch of the doorway when the black mass explodes on his left side. "Arrghhhh!" He screams as he falls to the ground amid rubble. Velius walks up next to Ifrit's head and sighs. "Pathetic humans! You tricked me!  Weaklings! If it were fair odds... Damn... you..." Velius smile and says, "Any other last words?" Ifrit growls at Velius and closes his eyes. Velius makes a large stroke with his sword, decapitating Ifrit.  A firey ball comes up out of the god's body, and gets sucked into the Kisakko. Soon after Ifrit's body fades away. Now, Thranloom, Kisakko, and Final Fight now have the powers of Earth, Fire, and Ice. The party is now Velius, Lin, Sage, Jewel, and Roq.

As the party trudges on, they reach a silhoutted figure standing in front of them. Velius asks, "Move out of the way, we are here for serious business!" The figure slowly lifts his head and casts a heavy gaze on Velius and speaks, "You have something you should not." The cloaked figure suddenly thrusts his arms up and black smoke clots the room! Everyone looks around, dazed (and confused).  Suddenly, Velius feels Kissako brutally ripped from his grasp! The strangers voice is heard echoeing far away, "This is my master's sword, not yours, bastard!" The smoke clears and the party looks around. The stranger is gone. "Dammit!" says the angry Velius as the party moves on. Luckily, Velius still has the Body-Crushing axe Thranloom to defend himself. The party reaches a large door with metal rivets all over it and...

"What the hell?! This crazy shit is always happening!" Yells Velius. Sage slowly comtemplates. "I believe that was our old friend- Spectre. He has given the Kisakko back to Kamain, no doubt."  After a few moments Roq adds, "That sucks." Velius whips Thranloom into the mushy earth, and curses. "Damn it! If they can do that that easily then we have no chance! I will kill Spectre for good next time we meet!" Lin speaks, "Well... We'll have to hold on to our weapons better. Better get used to the strangeness- especially when we are going up against a devil." Sage speedily puts his two cents in, "Even more so is that it is Kamain Kelineva with a Devil inside of him. And not only is it a devil, but it is the king of all devils! There are many opposing forces." Roq surveys the landscape. In front of them is the first barrier gates between them and Heeter. "Heeter is on the peninsula of Dementia-Dane. The information that I gathered was that they have put large walls up around the city that go from coast to coast. I think there are only two gates and then once past those there is an open field, not yet contaminated by the wretched swamps of this area. In that field lies the city of Heeter. We've already went past one of those barricades." Everyone nods in understanding. Velius walks over and picks Thranloom up. "I will... save my brother." He says and begins to walk toward the large gateway door. With the end of the axe, Velius strikes the door, and if gets flung away, busted in half. He walks through the open door, and surveys the area on the other side. "Whoa..." He says as he looks out over the city of Heeter. The borders of the city are lined with small walls, and there are gates all over. But the thing that amazed hiim so much was the vast tower in the center. At the top lies a sign that is very large and legible from even at the distance they are at. It reads, 'Ener-Craft Guild'. "What the hell is an Ener-Craft?" Velius mumbles with great confusion. Roq bursts in, "Ah! Ener-Craft are what they call those boats that run on the mixture I was telling you all about! I jes' remembered. We can easily get by one of those gates and slip into the city, but..." Everyone looks right at Roq. "But the problem will be fitting in. Everyone here wears extremly strange clothes. Trust me- they wear stuff that looks like aluminum wrapped around thier body. Think it's some kinda fasion statement or somethin'. Let's get goin'!" Roq jogs off toward the city of Heeter.

As they reach the outskirts of the city, they see a large hill. "What's that?" asks Jewel. The party trudges up the small hill and looks downward. "A garbage dump." says Sage. Roq notes, "This would be an excellent time to grab some junk and wear weird clothes like the people of Heeter." Lin nods, "Yep! Everything is going according to plan!" But suddenly, irony rears it's ugly head. A man dressed as a guard approaches the crew. Lin whispers to Velius, "He's just a little guard, he can't stand up to us. Think I should fry him?" Velius smiles and nods. "FIREBALL!" yells Lin as a tailed fireball slams into the the man. "Oky, let's go." says Lin. Then a voice from the man speaks, "I can't be defeated like that. Sorry to deceive you like that, Lin." With that, the man rips off his burning guard uniform to see a different uniform underneath. He then tears off his helmet reavling himself to be..."FAMOS!" shouts Lin. Jewel says, "This must be that rival Sword Mage that Garis guy was talking about. Let's all kick his ass and get on with everything!" But Lin sticks out her arm to stop Jewel from advancing. "Sorry Jewel, this has gotta be a one-on-one. Sword Mage vs Sword Mage." Famos laughs, "It seems I have misjudged you Lin, I apologize." The two go back down the hill and prepare for a deadly battle. "I'm sorry for doing this and all, I mean killing you, Lin. But I have to advance. No hard feelings. Hahaha!" Famos and Lin quickly draw their blades. "Enshou Wall!!!" shouts Famos as a beam rips across the ground! But Lin throws up her energy shield and repels it. "Yeah yeah, Famos...any new tricks?" Famos slowly circles backwards and notes, "Yeah...GRAV-DUAN!" Suddenly, Lin feels herself being drawn to the ground by a crushing force of gravity as she is held in place by a small circle of force. "Ms. Lin...tsk tsk, can't even get out of my spell? GRAV-UE!!" Famos rockets high into the air from a reverse of gravity then charges downward with his blade! But before he can strike, his spell wears off and Lin dashes out of the way as the sword of Famos buries into the ground! Lin counterattacks with a slash, which is blocked. "No Lin, I have learned all of the Sword Mage techniques! Wuahahaha!" fanatically yells Famos. "Oh crap!" says Lin. "Feel the taste of ultimate power! FUREA-HYU!!" says Famos. Lin throws up her energy shield, but a large crushing energy-flare crashes into her and shatters her energy shield, sending her flying. Famos walks up the the battered Lin. "How sad. You only knew one technique, which was useless." says Famos as he looks down at the weakened Lin. "Argh...how?" she asks. "I've gained power, enough to defeat Sensei Garis. I just wanted to see you suffer, Lin." he adds. The party looks on at the scene. "POISION!!" yells Famos as poisonous needles materialized and jab into the prone Lin. "You...you used a poisonous attack, that...is against out practices..." Lin says. Famos looks down and laughs, "I don't care!" Right then, a familiar voice says, "Famos! You have been using non-Sword Mage techniques! Your use of Poison shows that you have no honor!" Sensei Garis is standing, his blue robe flapping in the wind. Famos grits his teeth and casts the powerful spell Furea-Hyu again at Garis! But the crashing energy flare is deflected by Garis's amazingly more powerful energy shield! "Dammit, I must train longer!" says Famos as he throws down a smoke bomb and vanishes. Jewel starts healing Lin with a spell, and Garis is gone. The party re-groups and continues to look for the odd clothes they must wear.

Roq begins rumaging through the junk first. The others are hesitating. "I will not search around in that filth!" says Sage. Jewel shrugs and begins searching herself. Velius speaks, "I think we could find a better way. Wouldn't they have a clothes shop somewhere in town?" Roq stops his searching and answers him, "Yeah, I'm positive they would. That would probably be one of the first shops that you came across. But the prices would be high and your cover would be blown until you got the clothes. Do whatever." Sage and Velius decide they will wait and find a shop. Roq wanders off into the distance. Lin begins to look alongside Jewel. Roq yells, "Awww... that is so cool! ...But it ain't my color of choice... Too bad." Jewel pokes her head up and runs toward Roq's voice. When the two woman reach him, he is standing next to a freshly murdered person. The clothes they are wearing are quite nice. It is a one piece jump suit that is the color of the sky, and has a texture like that of nylon. It is tight fitting and is currently wrapped around a fairly pretty woman. "Ehhk." gestures Lin. Jewel is less offended by the sight and begins to strip the clothes off of the woman, slipping into them herself. "Hot damn!" Yells Roq again. He picks up a couple garments. "Who would throw all these away?" He picks up the first piece- purple vambraces (two of them, one for each arm). The next piece is large purple baggy pants that are so shiny they look metallic. The last part of the set is a strange necklace type garment. It has a button up strap that attaches around the wearers' neck, and hangs down thier back. The part that is attached to the neck strap is a bunch of large feathers, all dyed purple to match the rest of the outfit. Roq hastily begins to change into them. When he is done, he has the large pants on, his semi-muscular chest exposed, a vambrace on each arm, and the necklace/cape of feathers. "Whoa..." Jewel manages. Lin begins to laugh, but stops when Roq hands her the clothes he found for her. It is a pink two piece bikini type outfit. "I think that is the best we're going to find." Roq says with a slight grin forming on his face. Roq runs back toward Velius and Sage glancing back every now and then to take a peek at Lin changing. Jewel runs and catches up to Roq and diverts his attention. He gives a whistle and speeds ahead of her, reaching the two men first. "Ok, I figure-" Whack! Jewel smacks him on his right cheek. Roq continues, "That we can slip in and scout the place searching for a clothes shop. What do you-" Whack! Lin steps in front of Roq after slapping his other cheek. Yet he continues, "Think?"

The crew (all dressed up) enters Heeter. They pass some shadey looking guards and start to look around. Velius says, "Hey, where's a clothes shop at?" Suddenly, the 4 guards start charging the party! "Awww crap, already?!" asks Sage. 3 guards stop in front of the party, with one of the guards in the back. One of them says, "We haven't seen you before." Roq says, "Uhhh, we aren't from around here. Wheres the devil named Kamain anyways?" The 3 guards in front draw their swords and one speaks out, "No questions. Turn around and leave, or die!" Lin says, "What cruel people! I outta..." but Lin is cut off as the lone guard from the back instantly draws his sword! A tearing slash of darkness rips through the backs of the 3 guards! The guards are shredded from the single slash. Jewel yells, "That sword! You're that mysterious swordsman! What do you want?!" The swordsman takes a step forward. "The Sword of Nightmares has struck once again, thank you for recognizing it..." he says quietly. Velius steps forward, "I want some questions, who's side are you on?" The swordsman sheathes his sword, and the dark energy now only silently radiates from the top of the sheath. "Don't demand from me. I wanted to tell you that these ridiculous clothes are not needed. The devil Kamain has complete control of this town, and his servants are trained to recognize your party. Stay in the shadows, and try to avoid all these guards. You'll need your energy for later on." The swordsman walks into a shadow of a nearby house and dissapears. "How strange, I don't know about that guy." says Sage as the crew looks around some more.

Roq stamps his foot. "Damn it. These clothes are so cool. Screw that. Ima keep mine on!" Everyone else takes thier outfits off. Lin, quite embarrased, says, "Roq, you were misinformed about the clothes they wear. Look." She points at a person walking down the street, that is dressed in a regular brown tunic and pants. "...So? Maybe thier fasions change that fast. I just know that a one time they were dressed like... like... I am now. I like this though." Roq continues, "All right. We're goiong to have to look around a bit. To search a town this large together would be not only dangerous, but slow. So I think we should split up into groups." Sage, Velius, Lin, Jewel, and Roq stand staring at each other. Lin announces that she wants to go with Velius, also that she would feel the safest with him. Sage and his daughter are teamed up, and Roq is all by himself. "Ok. We came into this town through the east gate. Velius and Lin- you two search North. Sage and Jewel go South. I will head strait, towards the west. Meet back here, near the east entrance... main feature is that-" He points at a large tower that is labeled 'Roham's Fine Jewels'. "We meet back here when that clock-" He points at a large clock tower in the middle of the town, that in fact towers over all of the town. "When is strikes twelve. It being 10 AM now, that gives us all 14 hours. Get going." Everyone breaks off in thier assigned directions.
