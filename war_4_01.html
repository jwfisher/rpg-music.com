*Scene changes* Beao is standing up looking over at Verigal Deci. "Hahaha...you've hurt me, excellent." says Deci. "I know who you are, you're legendary. Unfortunatly, the legends are all talk. You may be able to kill others, but not me." coldy says Beao. Deci, an ageless ninja, teleports to Beao's back and makes a massive slash, which is deflected by his staff. "Dark-Gash!" shouts Beao! A dark energy wave pours into Deci, who falls to the ground, exhausted and drained. "It is a shame that your friends aren't here to be destroyed as well." hisses Beao. Beao leaps up high and shouts, "Death-shou Blade!" A giant energy blade slashes through Deci, shredding his armor. Beao dashes again through midair to another position and shouts, "Evil Flare!" A giant energy explosion flings Verigal Deci to the ground. Critically wounded, Deci tosses a smoke bomb down! "Pressurized Wind!" says Beao, now on the ground, blowing the smoke cloud away and slamming Deci into a tree. "Argh...I may not be able to beat you, but I'll kill your friends! Hahaha...argh..." says Deci as his master's power teleports him away. "Damn, I bet the swordsman is up to something. I must find out." Meanwhile Spectre is on his hands and knees and looks weak.. He rips off the piece of his uniform that covers the bottom half of his face. "Not so tough anymore, huh?" says Roq as he extends his vicious nails and goes for a jab at Spectre! A blinding flash from Spectre's sword slashes through Roq's nails, hacking them off! "Aeii!! They'll grow back in a couple hours, but I'll get you for that!" Roq is about to charge when he notices Spectre slowly walking out of the building. "What's going on?!" Roq shouts to Spectre. Specte stops, turns his head and sadly says, "I must go now." Clenching his fist, he continues walking.  Roq runs towards Spectre, "I won't let one of Devil Kamain's minions get away that easily!" Spectre stops, squints his eyes and spins around, and knocks back Roq with a pole extended from under his coat sleeve. It retracts as quickly as it was deployed. "Sorry, elf. But you have to stay out of my way. I apologize for what I have done...under that devil's control." Roq slowly stands up, confused. A small book is in the doorway where Spectre went out. Roq picks it up and flips to the bookmark. "Huh? 'The story of the Balance Knight: Spectre'? What's this? Don't have time to read it now, but I'll take it with me, gotta hurry up."

Velius walks up to the weapon and armor shop, staring at all the shiny items displayed in the window. "I could use some new armor..." Lin is right behind him and asks, "Do you have any money?" Velius nods, pulling out a sack of gold coins from his belt pouch. He tosses it into the air a couple of times and then sighs. "I don't know though. He tosses it into the air one more time. The bag of gold does not land back in his palm. "What the hell?" The gold bag is gone. "I didn't see anything! Where did it go?!" shouts Lin. "Dammit, you guys. Pay more attention." comes the familiar voice of Roq. "I ran about asking questions, looking for you two as quickly as possible." Velius looks at Roq, seeing his clothes ripped and his skin cut and bruised. "What happened?" he asks Roq. The elf begins in a very hurried tone, "I was attacked by Spectre. Only he was way far more powerful than the other times we fought him. Hatred gave him... upgrades. I managed to stay alive- wouldn't have if your brother, err, Hatred, hadn't showd up. Spectre was taunting me with jokes of your deaths', and obviosly some piece of Kamain still strives inside the demon, because he made short work of Spectre. Hatred... he... That monster wants you to join his ranks as second in commmand, Velius!" Velius stumbles back. "My brother still lives in the devil?" He looks down to the ground. "Kamain... I will not mess up again." says Velius under his breath. "Roq!" shouts Lin. "Hatred was here?!" Roq shakes his head, and gives a shoulder shrug. "Well, he wasn't here. I don't think. Not physically. But somehow he managed to inflict harm upon his minion, Spectre. He must have some device on him or something." Lin asks another question, "Well did you find the harbor?" Roq nods a bit. "Yeah, I believe so..." Then he thinks, 'I have to remember that book Spectre left.' Lin starts another inquiry, "Then I suppose we should go to the east gate. We do have 10 hours to spend though..." They all begin off toward the east gate anyway. A few paces into their journey and Velius smacks Roq in the back of the head. "Wha?!" shouts Roq. "Gimme my gold back." is Velius' reply.

Velius, Lin, and Roq walk towards the East Gate. Velius says, "Lemme see that book." They stop for a moment to look at it. "It is a book about history, and it goes back really far." Lin begins thumbing through it and suddenly stops on a page. "That old drawing has remarkable ressemblance to our buddy Verigal Deci!" Roq and Velius nod. Lin reads, " 'Verigal Deci, the ageless scourge of death. Deci has wreaked havoc across the lands for centuries, killing those around him. Deci was killed in a fight with a nameless hero hundreds of years ago. Although he was defeated, his legacy of destruction shall never be forgotten.' " The 3 look at eachother. "I wonder how he's alive if he's...dead?" asks Roq. They thumb through a few more pages when they come across another familiar face. "That's Spectre!" says Lin as she reads, " 'Spectre, the great Balance Knight. Always seeking a way to help those around him, he came across the King of Darkness: Akhis, then defeated him, and released all of Akhis's slaves. Although not critically wounded after the battle, the heroic Spectre was never seen again.' " Lin laughs, "Haha, heroic my ass." Roq looks serious, "Something is going on here. Spectre had an easy chance to kill me, but he didn't." With that, they continue walking.

Upon arriving at East Gate Roq announces that there will be a ship leaving in 8 hours- just an hour before the due meeting time. "I sure hope those two make it back here before we have to set out towards the ship. You guys do realize that we are going with or without them, don't you?" asks Velius. He continues, "I am very serious. I must go and find my Brother." Lin and Roq both nod their understanding. "We will wait here for 7 hours- it will take some time getting to the dock. And if the ship leaves in eight that gives us an hour for travel. We just sit around here for the next seven hours then, I guess." Velius sits down next to the open gateway, Roq stands leaning against the opposite wall, and Lin sits next to Velius. ***Scene Changes*** Jewel and Sage are well on their way into the sewers of Heeter. They went to a nearby tavern and gathered some information, which led them to believe there is a secret passage somewhere down in the sewers in the southern part of the city. Sage floats above the muck in the circular tunnel of metal that is the stained sewer. Jewel follows behind, but in a giant spider form. She climbs along on the cieling with her eight legs. "Father, perhaps we should just give up. We only have 7 hours until we need to be back at the East Gate. We can make it there in 3 if we run." Sage keeps on going and yells back, "This was your idea!" He goes on a little further and speaks again, "Besides, I can feel some kind of evil power up ahead." They continue on through the sewer. Pretty soon they begin to hear voices of humans. One says, "We gotta get this shipment back to where it came from." The voice comes from around a bend in the pipeline up ahead. The two mages sit back and listen. Another voice speaks, this one very gruff, "Aye. We will take it back on our ship. What is in the crate anyway?" There is a scraping of wood against wood sound heard and then a loud gasp. The gruff voice begins, "What the bloody ghost was that?" The other man answers his pal's question with, "Those are just the experiments. They took 'er off the street." The gruff man again, "A gutter snipe, eh? Rusty little trollop. Serves 'em right. Such trash. But what was done to... it?" Some laughter from the normal sounding man. "Well... that's a secret. But be assured she won't bother your voyage." Sage whispers, "Looks like we found something else..." Some grinding noises intrude on Sage's speech. It sounds like a mechanical grinding of gears. Sage waves for his daughter to follow him. They both proceed around the corner to find the next sewer tunnel empty. Just as they peek around the grinding noises halt. "What the..?" starts Sage. Jewel shoots into his mind, "Turn around!" Sage does so to see two scruffy looking men with scragly beards, cutlasses out, and plenty of facial peircings. "Arrr... Whatcha be doing here landlubber?" Sage almost laughs. He's never heard such a different type of dialogue. Jewel does laugh, although only into her father's head, for she is still in a spider form. "We'll gutcha!" yells the other pirate and they both charge. Sage flicks his wrist and his hand is surrounding by winds streams. The streams almost look like outward manifestations of his veins and arteries, flowing and throbing. "Seismic... ahhh.... Shout!" yells Sage, and on cue, the winds on his hand flow outward, and fill the whole tunnel. The windstorm blows the two pirates back down the tunnel that Sage and Jewel came through. As they bounce through the sewer, the two pirates shout their shrieks of pain. "Pulling out the big guns, eh daddy?" says Jewel.

*** Back with Velius, Lin, and Roq *** Lin yawns and leans her back onto a wall, but something suddenly blocks the warm sunlight hitting her face. "No one has long withstood my assault. I commend your efforts. But enough playing around!" says a familiar voice. The 3 slowly stand up and gaze at the silhoutted figure. "You again," says Velius, as he draws his weapon. Roq shouts, "This will be the last time you mess with us!" Lin teleports a sword into her hand and gets into a fighting position and says, "Verigal Deci, we're gonna kick your ass really bad this time!" Deci jumps up high and launches smoke bombs at the party! "Beao did almost destroy me, but I recover incredibly fast! Take this!" Deci flings out a triple fold of shurikens which explode near the party, flinging them apart! "Enshou Wall!" yells Lin as the white-beam shoots upwards at Deci! "Pathetic!" says Verigal Deci, as he evades the beam and charges downward at Lin with his blade! But instead of evading, Lin smacks his sword away and returns her blade inward for a deep cut, spins around, and delivers a side kick into Deci's chest, flinging him away. "You are good." says Deci, his wound healing before them. "But I am eternal now. I cannot be killed." Deci is distracted and Velius smashes his axe downward at Deci! The hit connects and simply breaks off some armor. Roq slashes Deci's face into ribbons with his nails and backs off. Deci reaches into his uniform and throws out 3 strange metal projectiles! They unravel in midflight and constrict around the party members, trapping their arms to their sides. "Urghh, can't move!" says Velius. "You 3 cannot defeat me. I shall dispose of Lin and Roq, and Velius shall be spared." Deci walks up to Roq, and runs him through with his sword. Blood squirts out of Roq's mouth and he falls to the ground. "Now you, Lin." Horrified, Velius summons all of his strength and shatters his bonds! He clefts Thranloom and smashes it into Deci! A large energy wave is created from the impact! Also enraged, Lin charges up all of her energy and breaks through her bonds! "Furea-Hyu!" she yells, summoning her most powerful Sword Mage attack! A vicious energy flare slams into Deci, shattering his frame. "Harghhhh...." mumbles the battered Deci. "Bastards....I...will....be back..." he says, as his body turns to dust and blows away with the wind. Lin rushes to Roq, to find him still breathing. She begins her long restoring spell. After an hour of healing spells, Roq stands up, alive. Lin is asleep due to exhaustion. Roq looks down on her sympathetically. Velius looks at Roq and says, "That was a close one, Roq." Roq does a small chuckle and says, "Eheh, I wonder why he stabbed me first? I must be pretty unlucky." The 2 chuckle a bit and wait on for Sage and Jewel to meet them.

With 5 hours left until they have to be at east gate, Sage and his daughter Jewel make their way toward the two pirates. When they reach the wind-blown men they find one twisted at all the wrong angles. Obviously dead, Sage disregards him and walks up to the other one lying in the sewer muck. He hefts the pirate by his collar. "Wake up, dammit!" yells Sage. He is visibly pissed- more than usual decides Jewel. The pirate come to after Sage smacks him a couple times. "You poor wretch. Why did you attack us?" The pirate smiles a grin of missing teeth, his gums black. It is the one with the gruffy voice. He says, "Arr, think you're good, eh? That be just a taste of what's ta' come!" The pirate begins kicking his legs. Sage throws the scruby man against the sewer wall. "Damn you! Foolish outlaw! Answer my question!" The pirate gets up slowly and gives another smirk. "The cap'n gives me ma' orders, goooood sir." Sage turns around and smiles at Jewel. With a sudden burst of speed, the mage swings around and yells, "Flaming Torpedo!" A pole-shaped firey projectile forms in front of Sage and shoots out at the pirate. The burning shot comes into contact with the man's right leg, and burns it completely off. "Looks like you'll be needing a peg-leg too." says Jewel. "Arr! What do you want from me, scallawag!?" Sage gives a frown and a very evil stare. "Tell me who your leader is." The pirate shrugs and says, "I only take orders from me cap'n. I be tellin' ye no more." Sage looks toward the cieling as he casts his final spell on the pirate. "Fingers of Inferno." Flames jet out from Sage's fingertips and begin to cook the pirate. After a moment he is reduced to a burnt skeleton. "Come on Jewel. Let's go back." Jewel searches the area frantically. "But father! I still sense an evil power!" Sage turns around and eyes the new figure at the end of the tunnel. This stranger is dressed in a large black cloak that billows behind him. His flesh is deep blue and has red tattoos tracing veins and arteries. He has no lips, revealing pearly white teeth. His teeth are shaped like that of a sharks-triangular. His grin everlasting. "What the hell? This never ends! Would you be so kind as to tell us who you are?" The stranger's voice is like wind in the grass. He says, "I am Vethra. Perhaps you've heard of me?" Jewel reels back and opens her mouth in fear. Nothing is said for a moment, but then Jewel breaks the silence by laughing. Sage smacks his daughter in the face and says in a grim tone, "This is no joke. You should have known Jewel the instant you saw him. I didn't want it to be him... Why!? How can you be here!?" Vethra explains, "You see, my great Brother Hatred is going to conquer the whole multiverse. He needs somebody to help rid the worlds of low-life creatures like you.  I'm just the demon. Of course he had to sacrifice a life... a few lives to bring me back. You know he thought that using the Monastery of Sage as a demon summoning area was a good idea." Sage's jaw drops. "You didn't! My priests! Hatred turned them into his minions and called forth you! Was that all that has happened? Is it just you and Hatred?" The demon begins, "I was sent here only to mock you, do not worry- I won't harm you too much, not yet. But actually this is getting quite amusing. To tell you the truth... hehehe... we now have a total of 3 Demon Kings revived. There is our lord and master, Hatred, Me, and Bloodman (formerly known as Zorack, heh). Sage, you will lead us to more souls in which we may taint. Keep going on your journey." Sage waves his right hand out and shouts, "High-Energy-Javalin!" A quick shot of white light screams through the sewer and strikes Vethra. He oesn't even flinch. "Have fun." says the demon before he vanishes. "Damn it! Damn it! Damn it all to hell!" yells Sage as he casts lightning spells into the dead pirates' bodies. Jewel walks over to her father and says under her breath, "Forgotten Spell of Tranquility, Release..." After muttering those few words Sage slumps into his daughters arms. "Sorry, dad..." she says. Then Jewel carries her father off toward the east gate with 4 hours left. *** Scene Change *** "Damn man. They got 3 hours to get here before we gotta go." says Roq. Lin nods slowly and answers, "Maybe we should go find them. So if we run into any more troublle we'll have better odds." Velius shakes his head and starts, "Naw. We can't. What if we go down that street and they come down this street? Then we'll totally miss each other and everything will be messed up. Let's just wait for three more hours."

*** Scene changes to a cemetary *** Beao stands over a grave, with his eyes closed and head down, whispering something quietly. He slowly turns around to see what he expected, the mysterious swordsman sitting down on a bench. Beao asks, "What exactly are you up to? It's not clear who's side you're on." The swordsman says, "Hmph...and what about yourself? You seem to have your own ambitions." Beao slowly opens his eyes and stares at the swordsman and says, "Whatever is on my agenda is of no concern of yours. I simply want to put an end to this 'Hatred' entity, but as you know, my powers as a Dark Preist are somewhat 'innefective' against a being of his spiritual nature." The mysterious swordsman looks to the side and speaks, "I have been assisting Velius's party to some degree. Beao, you know that they may be our last hope of maintaining the balance in this world." Beao closes his eyes and leans against a tree and speaks, "Indeed, but what if Velius is turned to evil? Sage and Jewel are strong for their classes, but can't match Hatred and the Demon Kings. Roq is clever as well, but it takes more than that. As for Lin, keep an eye on her, she's becoming quite powerful." The swordsman stands up and says, "She doesn't have it in her to kill Kamain, even if she did have...the right equipment." Beao ponders for a second and replies, "I should have known. You and your 'Sword of Nightmares' could only empower Hatred. It is devastating against all other walks of life, yet it makes you extremely vulnerable to his power." The swordsman walks close to Beao and squints his eyes, "Of course. But one has to wonder if Lin has it in her to wield the opposite reflection of my blade, the legendary 'Sword of Dreams'." Beao does a small laugh, "I hope Velius can do it. I don't want to have to break the seal of the Sword of Dreams." The swordsman replies, "Yes, that is a daunting task. We'll see if Velius can take care of Hatred somehow. He isn't powered by darkness, like us." The 2 look away at the same time and walk off...

*** Scene Changes to a dark, gothic castle *** Spectre kneels before his grand master, Hatred. Gazing around hid master's sanctaury Spectre sees his most hated rival, Vethra. Spectre had once tried to convince Hatred to infuse him with the spirit of one of the Demon Kings, but Hatred just laughed. Why is it that this Velius character gets the honor of accepting Hellion's spirit? Hellion is the second most powerful of the demons. Spectre would even settle for Gerras' soul, the third most powerful. I could still get my chance... Garras isn't revived yet. I may still be able to prove myslef worthy.' thinks Spectre. His thoughts are interupted by Hatred's booming voice. He yells, "Spectre... my faithful minion. I have thought about what you did, and the price you will pay. Velius is still my brother. His soul belongs bound to my devil brother, Hellion's soul. Are you prepared to face the consequences, brave Spectre?" Spectre nods deeply and bows even lower. "Good, I think you will be grateful. First, Spectre, you will once again be changed by my power, to better grant you demonic powers. Second, you must Roq. If you fail, you die. If you succeed- which I know you will- you will get a definite raise in rank. Are you ready?" Spectre nods once again. His master begins to perform an ancient spell of deformation and power. Spectre suddenly stands up and asks, "Sir, why must I kill the elf, Roq? Why not the mighty mage Sage? Or Beao for that matter?" Hatred inside of Kamain's body glowers down at Spectre. "I'm sorry, master." Spectre spits out. "No matter. Better you ask me now than have you try to ask me after the spell." Spectre is confused and afraid from that last sentance. "I will tell you, my loyal creature. Roq has been chosen to fight alongside Velius. They are the only two I am sure of that have been chosen. By who you wonder?" Spectre's eyes widen in the realization that his master can hear his every thought. "Those two have been chosen to come save me and destroy me by the Angel Kings' Spirits. I can tell- they have informed Love, who is still in my right eye. Spectre dares to glance at his master and notices that Kamain's right eye is completly white. It also glows like a candle. Spectre quickly looks back down to the ground, throwing himself into a kneeling position at the same time. "Now, Spectre. Prepare thyself. For transformation... and after that, use all of you r anger and hate to find Roq and kill him! Rain of Disfigurment!" yells Hatred. Fiery rocks plummet from the black ceiling and pummel Spectre. Everywhere a rock strikes, a horn grows. Everywhere flames from the rocks brush against him, his skin boils and large blisters appear. Everytime Spectre thinks of his proclaimed 'rank raise', he festers with more and more hate.

Velius, Lin, and Roq are still waiting at the gate. Velius says, "You know, just waiting around here, I'm sure that ANOTHER of Hatred's minions are gonna come after us." Roq smiles then says, "Maybe, but I'm gonna go across the street and grab some food." Velius and Lin nod. After a couple of minutes, the boredom is broken by a thundering explosion in the building where Roq entered! Roq is flung outside, right at Velius and Lin's feet. "Aww crap!" says Lin. Out of the rubble stands a hellish looking Spectre. "You...will all DIE." he speaks in a deformed voice. Spectre brandishes a deformation of his former blade, this time with wild edges which randomly branch out. Velius dashes up and sinks his axe down Spectre's right shoulder, but only gets rewarded with a bolt of energy which knocks him away. "USELESS, Velius..." he chants, as the gaping wound instantly seals up. Lin tries to use her Enshou Wall attack, but it is only absorbed by Spectre! "ROQ...you will DIE." monotonously speaks the twisted form of Spectre. Roq slams down from a rooftop on top of Spectre, but is thrown off his back into a wall. The trio groups up and stands to take another assault. "Hate Shear!" yells Spectre. A pitch black blade of energy slashes at our heroes! Lin jumps forwards with her energy barrier, but it shatters upon the blade's impact! The energy backlash throws her backwards into unconsiousness. Velius steps forwards, "Flare Vine!" A stream of fire wraps around his axe with sudden brutality! He charges and makes a lightning quick slash at Spectre's head, only to be deflected by Spectre's blade. Spectre does a massive backhand to Velius, rendering him out. "Damn, what can I do?" thinks Roq to himself, while looking over at a barrel. Roq grabs the barrel and smashes it over Spectre, covering him in wine. "Is that ALL you can do?" taunts Spectre, grabbing Roq and holding him up with one arm, about to do a killing strike. Suddenly, Roq whips out a dagger and plunges it into Spectre's heart area. Distracted, Roq escapes Spectre's grasp and wakes up Velius and Lin. The trio charges Spectre all at once! With the combination of Velius's axe, Lin's Furea-Hyu energy flare, and Roq's deep slash, Spectre finds himself on the ground, tore up. "Arghh...how?" Roq steps forward, "Now that you're all big and demonic, you lost all of that agility and fighting spirit you've had." Spectre laughs, and stands slowly, "Titan Bolt!" he shouts! A thunderous bolt of lightning nearly flash fry's the heroes, but it narrowly misses. Again, the trio runs arounds Spectre, making deep slashes, but not doing much damage. "How do we kill him?" asks Lin. "You cannot..." laughs Spectre. Suddenly, a booming voice enters the battlefield which says, "We believe it can be done!" It is the mysterious swordsman and Beao standing on a rooftop behind Spectre! Confused, Spectre whips around. Beao yells, "Terror Inferno!" A monstrous concentration of energy is developed overhead! The mysterious swordsman jumps high and plunges his Sword of Nightmares into the energy whirlwind, and comes down, shredding Spectre! Defeated, Spectre is faded into his human form. He lies on the ground, bleeding. Velius, Lin, Roq, Beao, and the swordsman group up and look at Spectre. "Hmmmm *cough*, you guys got me...damned Hatred..." he barely speaks. Not noticing behind them, the group is paralyzed by a spell which was being casted by Vethra! The large man steps forward, "Hahaha, child's play." Vethra pulls Spectre up and says, "Now that they are trapped, finish them off." Spectre holds up his sword, shaking. Looking into the eye of the immobilized Velius, Spectre remembers a long time back, when the honor of being a Balance Knight was all that was important. Vethra yells, "Hurry up!!" Spectre keeps staring into Velius's eyes, and suddenly plunges his sword deep into Vethra's chest! "What...the hell...are you doing?" says Vethra. "Bastard, tell Hatred that I'm not his puppet anymore!" yells Spectre to the wounded Vectra. "You'll die....soon." are Vethra's final words before sliding off of Spectre's blade and vanishing back to Hatred's lair. Although held by a spell, the group sees everything that has happened. A while later...Velius, Lin, and Roq finally come out of their stasis, only to see that the mysterious swordsman, Beao, and Spectre are missing somehow....perhaps they've teamed up?

"Jewel... don't you ever pull that again." Jewel nods but begins to sputter out an excuse. Her father cuts her off with, "I realize that I got out of hand, but still. Besides we need to get to the east gate. We are only 3 hours away from it. That is one more hour than we should need. We're still cutting it a bit close though. Come on." Really the east gate team is going to leave an hour ahead of the set time. So Sage and Jewel have only truly 2. Jewel and Sage sit in a cafe. Sage gets up and gives the nearby waitress some gold pieces from under his robes. "Thank you and have a good day." says the woman. Jewel leads the way out and toward the east gate. "C'mon dad. We can walk this slow. It'll take only about 2 hours." Sage sighs and slowly answers, "Why should we go slow? We have no reason to walk..." Jewel hushes her father and puts her arm around his back, hugging him closer. "We never talk much. Only when we argue do we exchange any conversation, although unintelligent. I want to have a talk with you." Sage swings his arm around his daughter's shoulder and hugs her back. "What is it?" he asks with a smile. Jewel replies, "Thanks for listening. Well... you see..." *** Scene Changes to the gothic castle belonging to Hatred *** "Yes sire... The two traitors escaped. Hiring a merc swordsman was a bad idea." Hatred appears from the darks of his throne. He stares at Vethra, who is reporting. "Do you mean to tell me I had a bad idea?" Vethra shakes wildly, and answers quickly, "No my liege! I am sorry!" Hatred kicks his demon brother in the jaw and sends him sprawling. Hatred points to a limp figure hanging on a nearby wall. "Nevermind. You have failed me quite a bit, but I think you have done well in making up for the loss. Spectre and the mysterious merc swordsman both escaped your clutches... but we now have a new toy." A flame flashes new above the hanging figure. Below the lit sconce hangs Beao shackled to the stone wall. He begins to moan. "Beao was not so fortunate. Good thing I sent in backup. Bloodman did well and will be rewarded. I am glad he was there to ensure the death of Spectre and capture this pesky mage. That swordsman though... He is a problem." Suddenly Beao shouts ou, startling Vethra. He yells, "Argh! Damn you!" He struggles to free himself from his chains. "Do not even bother. Those links are the strongest found anywhere. Oh, and don't bother casting spells either- they will only pain you." Beao shouts some more and puntuates his rantings with a lightning bolt. The bolt flows from his hands out towards Hatred, but don't even make it more than 2 feet. Instead the magic lightining turns around an strikes the caster in the chest. "Ahhh! Huh, uh, uh... You are quite the clever little demon aren't you?" asks Beao returning Hatred's mocking smile with one of his own. They both stare at each other, humorous grins on their faces.

Hatred says to Beao, "Did you really think that your Dark elemental powers mattered against me?" Beao grins, "Ha, you think things go your way, but they really don't. Pathetic." Hatred starts getting angry, "What are you ranting about, you fool?" Beao closes his eyes, "You see, Spectre and the swordsman are still about. Even as we speak, they are doing incomprehensible damage to your 'campaign'." Bloodman laughs, "I'm sorry, but I killed Spectre already. He didn't even land one hit." Beao laughs, "You should hire better help, Hatred. The Bloodman here doesn't even know when he strikes down an illusion spell. What a complete moron." Bloodman's smile changes to a frown. Beao continues, "It's pretty pathetic when it takes Bloodman, and your Death Mages just to subdue me." Hatred is flaring up with rage. Beao speaks on, "Yes, yes. I did manage to take out all of your Death Mages too, it'll take centuries to restore them." Hatred turns to Bloodman, "WHAT? All 50 of my Death Mages, destroyed?" Bloodman starts shaking, "Y...yes sire." Hatred grins and whispers to Beao, "You will die...slowly." Beao lets out a clever smile. "Go ahead, be my guest. FIRE GALA!!" A massive fire spell rocks the chamber, burning everyone inside. Hatred grabs Beao by the face, "No more of this foolishness, Dark Priest." Beao laughs, "It seems your magic bonds can't contain an indirect attack spell too well." Hatred suddenly grows more horns and spikes and says, "Trying to anger me into submission? I WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS!!" Vethra steps forward, "My liege, allow me to pain him for you!" Hatred glares around, "HOW DARE YOU?" Hatred grabs Vethra by the throat and slams his head into a wall. Seeing a distraction, Beao casts a super powerful spell, "WING EDGE!" A blade of slashing energy cuts through the bonds and frees him! Hatred turns around looking at Beao, "You are strong, shattering those bonds." Beao smiles and his holds his metallic staff out and says, "You didn't really expect them to hold me, did you? Atmosphia!!" Beao casts a spell that explodes in a massive blue flame and kicks up dust everywhere. Hatred laughs out loud, "You hurt me, Dark Preist, but it wasn't enough. Wait...what's this?" Beao is gone. Hatred is severely angry.

*** Scene Changes to a grassy meadow at night *** The mysterious swordsman and Beao sit in the grass, speaking. From high above, on a wood pole stuck in the ground, balances Spectre. Beao begins, "So what is your name?" The swordsman laughs and replies with, "You are lucky to be here. That Hatred slipped up like that gets me wondering..." Beao laughs too. "Sure. I made it out of there using my superior skills. I would have taken Hatred down but my magic does not harm him." The mysterious swordsman says, "No, you don't understand. Hatred is a Demon God. A Devil that has been gaining power every instant. You don't know as well as I do the extent of his strength. I think he wanted to let you go. Something is amiss." Beao shrugs and changes the topic. "I'll ask again, what is your true name?" The swordsman sighs and answers, "My name... long forgotten. Only ever recorded in a single history book. I will grant you the knowlede of my real name. Not my history though, I rather that remain discrete." Beao waits a few moments and begins to nod. "So what is it?" The swordsman quickly replies, "I was trying to remember. Calm down. Oh yes... that is it..." He trails off and Spectre yells down, "Out with it! I'm tired of refering to you as 'Hey You', or 'That Guy'. I really wish I wouldn't have given my book to Roq." The swordsman answers, "I was once called Temjin. That is all you need to know." Beao nods. "Alright, Temjin. That's better." Spectre jumps down and lands with the grace of a cat. "Temjin... I remember that name. Page 201- Temjin, the Restless Killer!" Temjin smacks Spectre, sending him to the ground on his back. "I said- nothing else needs to be known!" Spectre appolagizes, "I'm sorry. I didn't mean it- just got carried away. You know I really wasn't sure because you wear that cloth around your face." Temjin helps Spectre up and says, "Enough. What I once was is not important. Besides, I am no longer the person I was. Let us decide what to do next."

Velius, Lin, and Roq are still standing at the East Gate. Roq says, "Whatta we do now?" Lin is about to say something when she notices a silhoutted figure in the distance. Her face turns white instantly. Velius asks, "What's wrong?" Lin shakes her head, "Nothing...I...gotta go take care of something." Velius and Roq shrug and wait at the gate. Lin finds herself in a deserted section of the town. She walks up to a fountain with a large statue of a beast. Suddenly, a figure steps from his hiding place from behind the statue. Lin gasps. the figure says, "I must apologize for scaring you like that. Hmm...ready to die?" Lin's expression of surprise turns into a cruel smile, "Mr. Famos...long time no see." Famos reveals, "This time Garis won't stop me from killing you. He was keeping an eye on you, trying to protect you. But I have some mercenaries tying him up right now." Famos leaps up to the top of the statue and instantly brandishes his blade! Lin teleports her sword into her hand and prepares for a fight! "Take this Lin! Enshou Wall!" Lin charges upwards at Famos and avoids the energy beam, while knocking Famos off of his perch! "I'm better now, Famos! Seikyo-Shou!" A cristening energy blade speeds out of the ground and shreds through Famos. "Argh! I'm sorry for underestimating you!" he says. Famos goes for a sword slash which does a small cut on Lin's arm! Lin spins around to retaliate with her blade, but it is deflected! "Enough games, Lin! Furea-Hyu!" A radiating energy flare crashes down into Lin, who is knocked back onto the ground! "Ouch..." says Lin, as she gets up slowly. Famos is surprised and asks, "How'd you get up so easily? Last time I hit you with that you were out!" Lin smirks and directs her own version of the Sword Mage specialty energy attack right back at Famos, "FUREA-HYU!" A brighter burning energy flare slams into Famos, shattering all of his equipment. "Haaaargghhhh!" he screams and he is blasted through a brick wall. Lin walks up to him and looks down, "I've gotten stronger than you, and learned your predictable fighting style. Don't ever pester me again! Enshou Wall!" The white hot beam smashes directly into Famos and knocks him through a couple more walls and outside of the town. Lin smiles after a voice says, "Great job." It is Garis, who steps out of the shadows. Lin asks, "You were watching the whole time?!" Garis speaks, "Yeah, his mercenaries were pretty weak. Anyways, I must be off now, let me know when you are ready to challenge me to become a Master Sword Mage." Lin nods and Garis starts to walk away. "Wa....wait," she says stuttering, "Can you travel with me...errr...my party?" Garis smiles and says, "I'm afraid not...buuuut don't worry, I'll always be keeping an eye out for you." Lin blushes and says, "Bye bye!" and starts her walk back to the East Gate. When she gets back, Velius and Roq are missing. Lin mutters, "What the hell?"  Meanwhile...

Vethra and Bloodman slowly circle the two men, Velius and Roq. They all stand in a swamp near Heeter. "Hahaha." laughs Vethra. "I thought they were 'The Chosen Ones'. This is a joke!" Bloodman, skin of blood-red color. Human in all ways except the holes that dot his body. Small holes, but bug enough that you could look through. Many are on his chest, even where normally you would have a heart. "Come on! Can't those angels even choose good foes for us?" says Bloodman. Vethra answers for him, "The angels? We're talking about the pathetic angels that our lord and master killed with ease? Puuu-lease! Easy." Roq shoots in, "What are you talking about? 'Chosen Ones'?" Vethra laughs and replies, "Yes. The angels' ghosts believe you are strong enough to go against the devils. What were they thinking?" Bloodman laughs also, and hisses out, "Yesss. For you to even be worth our time you'd have to have some kind of..." He stops and laughs. Roq shouts out, "Special power?!" He sounded more like he knew the answer, and all doubt of that flees the devils' minds when Roq begins to float. Energy beams of purple and silver shoot up around him, appearing from the ground and rocketing into the heavens. Velius turns around and watches. When the beams stop coming from the earth, Roq hovers down to the ground and lands. "This... strength... it has been with me since childhood..." Then Roq snaps his head around and looks right at Vethra. Roq's skin looks metallic and silver and purple colors swim around on the surface of his metal looking skin. The colors are surges of pure energy. "Whoa! Roq, what happened!?" yells Velius. Roq ignores him and begins to walk toward Vethra. Both demons have stopped their circling. Instead they stare in amazement. "Whatever!" yells Vethra suddenly, pulling out a small dagger. He instantly slices at Roq. The elf twists his wrist up and reflects the dagger with a nail that is the shade of chrome. "Ha! This is pretty funny!" yells Vethra. Roq laughs- a laugh just like he normally would- nothing like Velius had expected. Roq points his middle fingers at Vethra and wills his nails to extend. Each finger releases a sliver of a nail that each spears one of Vethra's shoulders. His shoulders begin to turn bulbous and he yells, "What is this?!" Then his shoulders begin to look like balloons. Roq answers in a cheery voice, "I am infused with Gravity Elemental. Never woulda thought, eh?" Just as soon as he finishes Vethra begins to float above the ground. Roq aims his right pointer finger at the demon and suddenly his nail shoots out and pops one of Vethra's shoulders. The devil king falls back to the earth slowly. He screams in agony. Then yells, "Bloodman! What the hell are you doing!?" Velius turns around to see Bloodman fade out of existance. Before he totally disapears he says, "Vethra- you are dead." Roq smiles at the comment and slashes with all his nails. Vethra falls down in no less than 30 pieces. Roq begins to fall over. Velius catches him and says, "What is wrong?" Roq simply says, "Took a lot out of me. Must sleep."

*** Back with Beao, Spectre, and The Mysterious Swordsman (Temjin) *** Spectre looks at the swordsman (Temjin) and says, "So, restless killer, why are you called that?" Temjin gets angry and swiftly tries to backhand Spectre, who catches it with one hand. Spectre speaks with a darkened tone, "Don't try that again." Temjin replies, "Hmph....so why were you on Hatred's side Spectre? I don't know if we can trust you." Beao steps in, "That's enough! Temjin, Spectre here is a hero, but rumor has it he was cursed, which must have made him suspectible to Hatred's mind-altering abilities." Spectre clenches his fist and gazes at the full moon. "Yes Temjin, you would go 'evil' if a powerful devil's soul possesed you and touched the Stone of Hades as a parting gift for defeating him. Or are you evil right now?" The swordsman stops in his tracks, "So, how do you break this curse?" Beao speaks up, "Through years of meditation, so your own soul can strike back the curse." Spectre replies, "Yes...I was mere days away, until a certain Mr. McHeart distracted me by having Kamain and his party attack me. That was a ploy....then a guy named Alvato defeated me. Luckily, Hatred revived me to play on his side. But certain things happened to me when Alvato struck me down." Beao jumps in, "Indeed, the soul shattering sword, Kissako...took your soul." Temjin does a small laugh, "You have no soul, how amusing. I suppose your intent is to shatter Kissako and retrieve it?" Spectre nods and then continues walking. Beao points ahead to a deathly looking cave lair and grimly says, "Alright guys. Right now, we're the most powerful grouped force against Hatred. But we can't do anything against him directly, so we must help Velius and his party. Hopefully...we should have enough strength to complete this challenge up ahead."

Lin rushes over to Velius, who is hauling Roq on his shoulders. "What happened?" she asks as she helps lay Roq down near the gate. "He got all strong and stuff and it drained his power." Lin stands and comteplates. We are going to have to leave for that ship right now, or we're going to miss it." Velius nods and picks Roq up again. "I got him. Let's go. It was east right?" Lin nods and they go off in the direction of the harbor. *** Scene Changes *** Jewel walks down the busy street. Market vendors yell at her and others to sell their wares. Sage tags along behind. They got into an argument and aren't talking now. It has been silent for half of the trip, and they are almost there. when they reach the East Gate Jewel stomps furiously. "They left without us! We made it back at the right time!" Sage walks in from behind and begins, "It seems they have left. Perhaps they went along without us because they felt we were to weak?" He laughs at his own comment. Jewel turns around quickly and screeches in her fathers face, "What are you laughing about?! We need to find them!" Sage wipes some spittle off his chin. His enraged daughter begins to search around the area. "They are gone, for sure. I do not sense any familiar presense around here... Oh my." Jewel turns around again, after searching in a nearby garbage can, and yells, "What is it now!?" Sage's head slowly looks upward. Jewel follows his gaze, and sees the being at the top of the gate wall. "Gerras!" It is a Centaur, a horse-man. His hooves pound eagerly on the gate wall. Hi face is that of a normal human's. His only other feature that indicates something wrong about him is two arms have been removed elbow down, and replaced with crossbows. One of which he fires down at Jewel. She leaps away. "Ha! Ya' missed! How are you gonna reload without any hands! Hahahaha!" Gerras smiles and whips his arm. The arrow shot at Jewel flies back to his crossbow and latches in place. "What? Magic!" Gerras shakes his head 'no' and quietly says, "Let me show you." He holds out his other arm and aims at Sage. Jewel turns to see her father being held tight by Bloodman. Their faces are very recognizable, Jewel realizes as she thinks back to her days in mage school. The arrow on Gerras' right arm flies toward Sage. It strikes him in the chest, spraying blood everywhere. Jewel stares in horror. "Go!" manages Sage. Jewel begins to run out through the gateway, but Bloodman holds out his arm and a bony vine shoots forth from his wrist. It grabs onto Jewel and drags her back. Bloodman picks her up and holds her out for Gerras' deadly arrow. Gerras smiles and winks at her, before letting loose another arrow.  It strikes Jewel in the throat. She wheezes and then falls down. It pains her espescailly when Gerras yanks the thing out of her. Sage lies next to her, and tears stream down his face. "I... love you...Jewel..." Then everything fade to black for Jewel. The two demons laugh. Bloodman kicks Sage and he yelps. "I think your daughter is dead, pal. Perhaps you should follow suit, eh?" Sage's eyes begin to swirel with arcane winds, as he stares at his fallen daughter. His body is hefted upright by strong winds, that are visible, and are the shade of green. His veins begin to pulse, and they pump gree blood. In a burst of energy, the rage overtakes Sage. Bloodman looks good at the old mage. His eyes are green, as well as his hair, and the lines of his arteries and viens. The green winds surround him. Bloodman jumps back just as Sage raise his hand and yells, "EnSel Rush!" A great blast of wind collides with Bloodman, sending him out into the skies of the city. Two arrows whiz toward him but are repelled by the gale that is about him. Sage turns to the centaur and yells, "EnSel Crush!" Green winds slam into Gerras from every direction, breaking his bones, and spraying blood in many directions. The Demon falls from his perch on the gate. Sage waves a hand at him, and screams so loudly, "EnSel Slam!" With this command a great wind hefts the demon into the air and throws him against the east gateway arch multiple times. Until it crumbes on top of Gerras to be exact. "Demon! Vile creature! You are dead!" He looks to his daughter, and casts another spell. "EnSel Run." Then he points to the clock tower in the center of the town. He picks Jewel up and they both disapear in a flurry of storms. They reappear on top of that tower in the middle of Heeter. Sage lays his daughter down on top of the flat metal roof and looks out along the city. "I have nothing left." Jewel surpisingly still has a bit of life in her. She says with a raspy voice, "Father. I'm sorry we couldn't get along better. I love you. I'll be watching from above..." She casts a simple spell on her father, one of healing nature. The wound on his chest closes. "Jewelaaaaaaaa!" He shouts out into the night air. He slumps down next to her dead body and says, "I have nothing left. I'm sorry, my lovely daughter." He stands back up and waves a hand at her corpse. "EnSel Rush!" The green winds come and toss Jewel from the roof. They send her out toward the dark seas. "I love you..." Sage stands at the edge of the building and falls forward. "I'm sorry." He says before plunging toward the streets below. A strange ghostly figure follows him on his way down. It is Thragnar! "Sage. You must not do this. You are one chosen to defeat the Demons. Once they die, all those killed by them will be alive! Sage, I wish to see you all and be real. I'm sure Jewel will want the same." Sage says, "I am tired of this life." Thragnar retorts, "So you are going to leave us all? Abandon all those you cared about? Alvatos? Kamain? Even Jewel? You would leave your own child?" Sage suddenly stops falling, the winds support him. Good timing, as he is just an inch away from the pavement. He turns himself upright and stands. "What do I need to do, Thragnar?" The minotaur's spectre replies, "You must join up with Velius and Roq. Both of them have been chosen to lead the attack against the demons. Roq has already found his power, as have you. Velius is having trouble finding his. Now that it has surfaced, you need only call upon it. You power. You are that of wind. Roq is that of Gravity and steel. Velius is that of pure strength and friendship." Sage says, "Yes. I have heard this tale. I was chosen by the angels' ghosts. I am now glad that I didn't commit suicide." He adds the last part just as anohter ghost apears. It is Jewel. "Dad, save us. Save Kamain from that evil demon. Once it is all over we can live happily. We can work things out. I have to go now though father. Thragnar is the only one that was given such good time in spectral form. Buh-bye." Sage waves his salutations. "I will blast the hell outta Kamain. Literaly." Thragnar nods and says, "Find somewhere to rest. Quickly, before you collapse." Sage nods and says, "Yes, I will. You have been completely right so far. Thank you dear friend for saving our lives. Without you I would be a small puddle on this street." Thragnar grunts.

*** Party of Beao, Spectre, and Temjin *** The trio of overly powered characters walk in a line towards the dark cavern. Suddenly Spectre stops, "Damn!" Beao and the mysterious swordsman (Temjin) stop as well and Beao asks, "What's wrong?" Spectre clenches his fist and closes his eyes with savagry and speaks in an angry tone, "Hatred's minions...they've killed Jewel, Sage's daughter." Beao squints his eyes and whispers to himself, "Bastard Hatred...I'll kill you." Temjin starts walking when they come across a massive iron gate. Beao is silent and looks at Temjin then points at the gate. Temjin, the mysterious swordsman, brandishes his blade and does an overhead slash, which creates a vicious energy slash that covers the whole length of the door, splitting it in half! Spectre speaks, "Nice...now this place, what is it?" Beao says, "Although it appears to be a cavern, it is really the Palace of Aquarius." Spectre smiles and the group continues walking in. Torches suddenly light up throughout the rocky cavern, and a small army of 30 skeletons rises up. Temjin puts his hand over his head, "Crap, undead. I don't wanna take them hand-to-hand, the Sword of Nightmares has no effect on them. Spectre?" Quickly, Spectre holds out his blade, and whips across into the mass of skeletons, richocheting off of all of them in the course of 3 seconds. Spectre suddenly stops his incredibly quick attack, and they all crumble simultaneously. Beao says, "This is going to be too easy." Temjin and Spectre nod. They continue walking up until a giant log suddenly drops towards their position! Not even blinking, Beao puts up a shield around the crew, which the log splits on upon contact. "Pathetic traps," he mumbles. The trio finally reach the main room in the back. They see an ancient rune and Spectre wipes the dust off of it and reads, "In order for the sword to unseal, the most powerful black magic spell and black magic sword must be used simulteanously on the palace itself. Spectre grins and notes, "We have both...Temjin's Sword of Nightmares, and Beao's ultimate spell, whatever it is." They nod. Spectre shouts, "Well, do it quickly!" Beao laughs and says, "In here? do you want this whole cavern crumbling on top of us? Let us go outside." the trio walks about 4 miles away from the cave. Spectre says, "Alright, do your thing!" Temjin hands his Sword of Nightmares over to Beao and says, "Be cautious." Beao grips the sword with two hands and it starts radiating tremendous amounts of pitch black energy! The sword suddenly floats in front of Beao as he puts both of his hands facing each other in front of his chest. "Deepest source of darkness, bringer of sheer destruction, let the face of devastation enter this plane and change the face of this world!! NIGHTMARE LENS!!!" A huge pitch black lens forms in front of Beao, radiating energy that swallows all of the light around them! The giant black magic lens unleashes a massive swirling beam of darkness which connects to the Sword of Nightmares, and rockets towards the caverns! A massive explosion demolishes the Palace of Aquarius and the forest around it! The blast wave hits the trio, who are nearly knocked down! The Sword of Nightmares teleports itself back into the hands of Temjin who speaks, "Here we go..." A giant blue dragon emerges from the rubble and lets out a thundering roar! The dragon leaps into the sky with great agility and starts flying towards Spectre, Beao, and Temjin! Spectre notices the sheer size of it and yells to Beao, "Hit it with that spell you just casted!" Beao shakes his head, "No, I'm too drained." The dragon Aquarius lands in front of them! The force of it landing from the sky knocks the trio backwards 100 yards. They get up and see the dragon, with metallic looking blue scales. the 3 charge towards it, but it unleashes a breath attack which sends them all flying backwards. Aquarius unleashes it's raspy echoing voice, "You should not have unleashed me, you shall all DIE." Temjin skyrockets upwards and makes a radiating slash across it's face! The dragon lets out a yelp, then uses it's enormous hand to swipe Temjin, who was falling back towards the ground! Spectre holds up his sword and chants, "Psycho Vine!!" His sword charges with a neon green energy! Spectre uses his great agility to spiral up and around the dragon, causing hundreds of cuts across it's body! The dragon's eyes flare up and fire a powerful energy beam directly into Spectre, smashing him down into the ground. Beao floats up a few feet from the ground, "Pressurized Wind!" The massive wind has no effect on the dragon though, as it swings it's massive tail at the Beao, who throws up his energy shield! Although dampening the force, the mighty Aquarius shatters the shield and sends Beao flying into a tree, breaking it in half. Spectre and Temjin suddenly rush out of the forest and plunge their blades deep inside the dragon on both sides, puncturing it's massive scales. Temjin pulls out does a wide slash which flings a dark cut across Aquarius's heart area! Spectre jumps up to the same heart area and shouts, "Chainsaw Cut!" His sword starts vibrating back and forth with high velocity and cuts deep into the dragon's chest, sprawing purple blood everywhere! Seeing an opening, Beao casts his Atmosphia spell, and the blue explosion expands and rip's the giant dragon's chest open even more! Temjin holds out his sword and rockets into the dragon's exposed heart, tearing it to pieces! Aquarius shreiks and his body starts to rumble! The dragon starts disentegrating, and a bright light appears in the center of where it fell. Spectre grabs the object and says, "We did it, we unsealed the Sword of Dreams! But unfortunatly, if one of us were to use it in battle, it would destroy us instantly, not allowing dark people like us to strike with it. If only I were uncursed, but it should still prove useful in killing Hatred, he's very vulnerable to it. Let us find Lin and give the sword to her." Beao nods.Temjin finally laughs, "That would be cool if I could wield both swords in each hand!" Beao grins and says, "Go ahead and try, but don't come crying to me when you're a pile of ashes on the ground. Spectre, keep an eye on it, the Sword of Dreams is very important towards the death of Hatred!" Meanwhile...

Sage wakes up in a small room. "Where am I?" he asks himself. "Oh yeah... I'm at an Inn... 20 gold pieces, what a rip-off." He gingerly gets up and shakes the sleepiness from himself. "Wow... last night was... Jewel." He hangs his head low. To his right comes a familiar rumbling voice. "Friend Sage, you needn't worry about your daughter. She is in good hands- the angels were able to help her, like they did with me. Your worry is Hatred. Now... do you still feel like the adrenaline is pumping?" Sage nods, and adds, "Yes, although very slightly." Thragnar snorts and relies, "Good. Hold on to that. If you are ever in trouble again, begin to think of your troubles. It will bring forth more adrenaline, which half powers your transformation. You turned into your first level of power, called Wind Mage. Roq was in his second level form, Platnium Gravita. He has managed his speacial power in the past, so he is a little more advanced with it. Sage, Velius and Lin have left in a ship heading south." Sage catches on, and asks, "Where is the elf?" Thragnar suddenly looks up to the cieling and says, "He comes in search of you. I must go now- the angels call upon me. Fare well my friend." The spectre of the minotaur vanishes. Sage walks out of the tiny inn and looks around. "Where could he be...?" He finally decides that Roq will most likely find him instead of the other way around. "He is like a thief. Probably once was." The sly voice of Roq comes in from behind, "Damn straight." Sage turns around and smiles. He says, "I heard about your transformation." Roq nods and replies, "And I have heard of yours. Thragnar pointed me this way." Sage starts to mummble and fumbles out the question, "How do you harness the energy? I found it very hard to call forth my greater self, and..." Roq says, "It's simple man, jes' like Thragnar told ya'. Take hold of that power, and think of your troubles. Your spirit and body do the rest. You will get used to it after a short while. I hadn't used it in so long that it startled me when it came rushing in like a flood. A rush of adrenaline and the thought of dying, and letting that demon terrorize the world." Sage squints and slowly asks, "You, you think about the rest of the world at times... like that?" Roq nods. "I love this planet. Although I am a businessman, I am still an elf- and elvenkind worship the planet god, Gaia. But anyway. Sage, we need to steal oursleves a ride." Sage's eyes fly open, "Why steal?" Roq shakes his head and puts his hands up in defense. "Well, there aren't any ships we could sneak aboard leaving for Terriv for another month. We gotta get to a smaller craft and hijack it. We will ride it to the greater vessel that Velius and Lin are on. Trust me, I know the route the ship is taking.... I stole a map." Sage mummbles to himself and suddenly announces, "Alright, let's get on with it." They both head off toward the east docks. *** Scene Changes to a large cargo vessel *** Lin walks about in the massive hold, looking at all the crates lying about. "What is in these, I wonder?" A thump comes from one of the crates. "What the devil was that?!" yells Lin. Velius walks up behind her with a look of slight anger. "Pardon the expression," says Lin. "It is just I heard a loud noise from this crate." Velius shrugs. "So what? Probably some live animal waiting to get butchered or something." Lin throws her arms down and shouts, "How can you be so casual about it! I love animals..." Velius shrugs again and laughs, "We could open it and save the poor little creature, if you want." Lin looks up at him with a smile on her face. "Oh! Velius, you are so nice! C'mon!" She says walking over the the crate. Velius feels really stupid, since his statement was supposed to be a joke. "Alright..." he sighs. Lin uses her sword to pry off the side of a crate, its wooden panel falling down onto the floor. A bunch of yellow hay falls out. "Whoa! I don't think they ship live ones in packaging." says Velius. Another noise, only this new sound is a moan. "What! Velius!" She starts pawing through the hay. Lin uncovers a human face, although very pale. It has the code, 'B-325', stamped on its head. "What the?" says Velius as he uses his right hand and swings the great Thranloom over his head. "Stand back, Lin!" says Velius, and she does so. "Who are you?" asks Velius. Slowly the figure in the box gets up. Emerging from the hay, the two companions see it has a humanoid head, chest and that is about where the comparison stops. Its arms are the great clawed paws of a feline, and its legs are reverse-jointed, bug like legs. "What is this?!" shouts Lin. Velius looks at the creature, hard. "You see that? On its chest." Lin looks and sees a tattoo on its bare chest. "That is Hatred's insignia!" Lin pulls out her Fight Fantasy. Velius reels back and pulls fire power into the Thranloom. He lets the flames spread out from his weapon. Velius didn't plan too far ahead, as the boat's interiors quickly catch on fire. The creature from the box just stands there, looking at him. "It isn't doing anything." breoadcasts Lin. "Who cares! The boat is gonna go up in smoke! Get topside!" yells Velius as he runs up some steps leading to the deck. Lin follows.

Lin yells, "Of all the elements, why'd you use fire?!" Velius yells back, "I dunno! It seemed like a good idea at the time!" The two are standing on top of the large carrier boat, when suddenly, the creature leaps up high from the cargo area on top as well! It lets out a hideous shriek then rebounds high in the air! Velius and Lin try to watch it, but the sun shines too brightly! Velius keeps staring upwards until he notices something coming down right on top of him! The creature slams down on top of him, smashing him into the ship's deck! Before Lin can react, the creature jumps up high again! Lin spots it and uses the Enshou Wall, but it misses! The creature lands on top of her, smashing her into the deck as well! Velius gets up and attempts to charge the beast! He holds out Thranloom like a spear and uses the fire power again! The spear of flame covers the creature and knocks it to the ground! Lin is up and goes for a slash, but the creature simply catches her blade in it's handclaw! The bug-like legs slam out and kick Lin through a crate that was on to of the deck, sending wood chunks shattering through the air, and effectively knocking her out! Velius slowly approaches the creature, and starts circling it. The smoke is starting to get thick as it pours from the hull of the ship. "What the hell are you?" asks Velius as he grits his teeth, not expecting a reply. And then...

The creature with tiger paw hands is visible once again. It is not moving. Only standing and staring. Velius aims at the thing, but lowers his weapon when it chirps. After the bird noise, its head rotates a full circle. Velius chuckles and raises the Thranloom again, and sees that its head just keeps on spinning. "You're one funny little punk, I'll give you that..." says Velius before unleashing fire pent up in the great axe. As the spray of fire nears the odd monstrosity, its head begins to unwind extremly fast. As it does, it releases a very sickly looking green mist into the air. The green substance floats through the air, and totally disolves the hot fire going into it. The wooden pole of a mast nearby gets soaked in the green spray and begins to deteriorate. Slowly, the mast begins to descend... right toward where Lin is lying in the crate chunks. Velius shouts, "Lin! Get up!" as he runs toward her. 'I won't make it in time!' he thinks. Just when things seem like they can't be changed, a strong wind blows in from the west. The blast of wind sends the open mast flying through the air like a kite. The winds also knock out any and all flames on deck. Velius looks around, but is interupted by three sharp talons raking across his chest. The creature attacked him with its giant tiger paws. Velius jumps back and makes a very quick slash- even considering the weight of the Thranloom. The creature's right arm flings off into the ocean. No blood, no bone, no anything. The stump is a block of peach flesh. It almost seems as though it were clay. Velius pays no matter, and swings again. Way off. The monster retaliates with a backhand that send the yong man sprawling. Another wind comes aboard and blasts the creature back. Suddenly Sage is kneeling next to Velius and Roq is jumping at the enemy. "Come on, we must get off the ship." says Sage.

*** Back at Hatred's Lair *** The devil aspect of Kamain is sitting in his throne. Bloodman appears an kneels before him and speaks, "Vethra...he's gone." Hatred closes his eyes and a fiery aura explodes around him and he speaks in a grim tone, "Verigal Deci, destroyed. Spectre, on the side of the angels. Vethra, sliced to pieces. Even our minions, the Death Mages, and minor fools like Gerras the Centaur are dust. Only myself, and you, the damned Bloodman remain." A sly voice enters the conversation, "And me as well." Bloodman grins and looks at the figure that appears. "How's everything going, Hatred?" the figure asks. The monstrous Demon King replies, "Mistress Ayoshaa, you have arrived." Bloodman gets angry, "Who the hell is this?" Hatred puts his hand over Bloodman's head and smashes it to the ground, shattering his face. Ayoshaa lets out a small evil giggle. She is in a black dress with red designs, holding a staff with a dark crystal ball at the end of it. Her wide shoulder armor supports a wide cape. Her eyes reflect an intriguing blood red color. Bloodman stands up, gripping his mangled face in pain and says, "What's she gonna do? I already killed Jewel, I just need to get back into action." Ayoshaa laughs and says, "You fled the scene when Vethra was being killed by Roq. Pathetic." Bloodman plunges his boney hand around Ayoshaa's throat and yells, "That's the first and last time you mock me, woman! Prepare to die!" The woman smiles as a vertical slit appears on her forehead! Bloodman says, "What the hell?" A third eye sudden opens wide, and gazes into Bloodman's eyes. A thin red beam plunges from the 3rd eye into the forehead of Bloodman! His hand takes itself off of Ayoshaa's throat, and his fists suddenly point towards his eyes. Dual boney projections form his hands strike through his eyes, popping them like grapes! Hatred laughs and kicks Bloodman onto his face, "You'll recover in a while. Wuahahaha!!" Bloodman suddenly slams up and down on the ceiling and ground for a minute until Ayoshaa's evil eye closes on her forehead. She smiles and teleports somewhere unknown.

*** Same Place *** Bloodman lies bloodied and bruised on the floor, but not broken. Hatred sits in his arge dark throne. "What am I going to do? Ayoshaa is powerful... but I need more servents. And you!" yells Possessed Kamain. "I haven't decided what is to become of you!" A small mummble comes from Bloodman's body. Hatred booms, "Bloodman, I want you to produce your two strongest bone vine warriors." He waits a few moments and when he only hears low mummbles, Hatred casts a Bloodhealing spell on the demonic vampire. Slowly getting up, Bloodman says, "I appoligize, my lord. I thought she was perhaps the enemy. I will do your bidding." Hatred nods, and replies, "Good, good. Now summon them." Bloodman nods and begins to flex his arms. In a quick burst of blood, two long bone vines emerge from Bloodman's wrists.  They land on the floor and coil into small piles. After the piles of bone vine are about three foot high, and almost two feet in diameter, Bloodman's vines run dry. He slumps to the ground, next to each of his bone vine piles. "I am very weak now..." says Bloodman. Hatred smiles and says, "Now animate them." Bloodman gives a exhausted sigh and begins to weave an animation spell about them. Suddenly, the bones vines fold in on themselves, and burst out in vaugly humainoid shaped bone creatures. They are human shaped, save for the fact that their arms are elongated and drag on the ground. The lower jaws are also extremely oversized, as they jut out in front of the skull about one foot. The feet are not normal, either-instead there are three large talons that spur off on each leg, two talons pointing fore, the last one, backward. This last spell makes Bloodman fall backwards from his kneeling position. Hatred laughs a horrible laugh, and asks, "Bloodman... Is that your bone, or just the extra stuff?" Bloodman simply grunts, but Hatred knows what the answer is. "Good. I thought so. Well, these two are under my control, as of... now." He waves his hand over the bone warriors and they look to Hatred for orders. "Nice. Now I will cast a very beauitful spell on you." Bloodman attempt to roll away, but is too weak. Hatred waves his hand at Bloodman, and within a second, the vampire begins to... melt. Bloodman melts down into a small red pile. "Hmm... Hope I can do this." He waves both of his hands, and the red pile forms up into two more skeletal warriors. Only these new ones have crimson blood flowing through non-existant viens. Hatred nods and some blood from the new creatures floats towards the other two. Now all the skeletal monsters are exactly the same. "Velius shall not save his brother, rather I, Kamain, shall save him."

The vile Mistress Ayoshaa is back in her own secluded lair, a small cottage in the middle of a large forest. It's quite a clean little place for a sorceress of her abilities and evil powers. She takes a black cloth off of a round sphere, unveiling it to be a large crystal ball with various electrical currents running through it. She gazes into an image of the Spectre, who now appears to be seperated from Beao and Temjin. She smiles and immediatly teleports to his position, an open meadow. Spectre turns around and asks, "Can I help you?" She replies, "I am Mistress Ayoshaa. You know who I am." Spectre looks at her and says, "Ah yes, you must be one of Hatred's minions." Ayoshaa smirks and notes, "Ah, I see you have the Sword of Dreams strapped to your back. Give it to me, so that it may never be used against our lord Hatred!" Spectre laughs out loud, "Our lord? No one is my lord. He took advantage of my curse and used me with his dark manipulations. Go away." Ayoshaa lunges at Spectre with her staff, but he easily and brutally whacks it out of her hands with his blade. She taunts and says, "Why not use the Sword of Dreams on me? Hahaha!" Spectre grins, "I'm sure we both wouldn't want that!" as he zips across the ground towards Ayoshaa! Her 3rd eye opens up, and a red beam connects to Spectre's forehead, freezing him. She smiles and says, "Give me the sword on your back." Unable to control his body, Spectre grabs the Sword of Dreams and holds it in front of him for Ayoshaa to take, but suddenly, Temjin's Sword of Nightmares is ran through Ayoshaa's back! She gasps and then turns around to see Beao and Temjin smirking. She lets out a yelp and says, "Didn't...know...that you two were here also...EVIL FLARE!!!" A large darkness explosion covers Beao and Temjin, while Spectre is held in place! The spell has little effect on them, but Ayoshaa's wound has sealed up and she says, "The Sword of Nightmares cannot kill me, I am far too evil! Wuahaha! Now Spectre, my loyal puppet, destroy them!" Spectre dashes at Beao, but suddenly turns and shoulder rams Ayoshaa, who goes tumbling down the grassy hill! She teleports out. Spectre laughs, "I am not controlled that easily. It would take her full concentration to do that. Thanks, Temjin." Beao replies, "Interesting, she is quite powerful though. Her 'evil eye' is odd..." Temjin grimly says, "I'll cut it out of her head." Meanwhile...

*** On Greater Vessel Headed to Terriv *** Roq holds his pointer finger outward, toward the sea, with the odd creature impaled on his fingernail. His nail begins to retract, slipping out of the monster's forehead. It slumps dead into the sea. "This ship is gonna sink. Fast." says Roq as he peers over the railing. He walks back to Sage, Lin and Velius. They all stand waiting for him. "Where we gonna go?" asks Roq. Sage nods quikly and replies even faster, "I will have to change." Sage takes a few steps back, and says, "Get ready for this." Swirling energies of green shades surround Sage, as he begins to once again change into his Wind Mage form. When finished, Velius yells, "What is going on?!" He is confused, as well as Lin. "Nevermind that. We must go." is all that Sage says. "EnSel Slide!" he yells, as he points southward. The arcane winds surround the whole group, and they are instantly transported to a new landscape. Tall trees surround them. Nothing but greenery. Roq bursts out after closly inspecting a tree. "Damn it! We are in the Misleading Forest! Look here!" he points to a tree, then a nother. Everywhere he sticks his finger are arrows etched into the trees. The arrows point in random directions. Velius says, "No problem, Sage can teleport us out of here." Roq slowly shakes his head no, as Sage says, "EnSel Slide!" The winds do not even come. Roq yells, "Magic is totally nulled in this forest! We aren't even on the right land mass, either!" Velius asks him, "What do you mean? We aren't on Terriv?" Roq smiles and says, "Oh, we are on the land labeled Terriv. An island of Terriv, though, I might point out. This is great. Well... lets get started." Velius raises an eyebrow. Roq continues, "We have to follow the arrows on the trees until we find our way out. Some trees point in the wrong direction, while just one set of trees points in the correct direction. Oh, and don't wander far from eachother- the forest will consume loners."
